keepalived (1.0.2-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.
  * Fixed previous changelog entry's year (2002 -> 2003), so it doesn's appear
    that I time travel.  At the very least, I wouldn't want people discovering
    my secret, and risk my time machine falling into the wrong hands.
  * Upstream docs changed location; updated.
  * Dropped dh_undocumented usage.
  * Added reload support to the init script.
