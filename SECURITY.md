# Security Policy

Here at the Keepalived community security is very important to us.

## Reporting a Vulnerability
If you discover any issue regarding security, we'd appreciate a non-public disclosure of the information, so please disclose the information responsibly by sending an email to Alexandre Cassen <acassen@gmail.com> and not by creating a GitHub issue or start a dialog in the keepalived community at groups.io. 
We will respond swiftly to fix verifiable security issues along with the disclosure being coordinated with vendors and other relevant security teams.
