The main goal of the keepalived project is to add a strong & robust
keepalive facility to the Linux Virtual Server project.
It implements a multilayer TCP/IP stack checks. Keepalived implements
a framework based on three family checks : Layer3, Layer4 & Layer5. 
This framework gives the daemon the ability of checking a LVS server 
pool states. Keepalived can be sumarize as a LVS driving daemon.

Keepalived implementation is based on an I/O multiplexer to handle a 
strong multi-threading framework. All the events process use this I/O
multiplexer.
