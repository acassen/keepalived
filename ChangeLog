	* keepalived-1.2.2 released.
	* IPv6 : extended autoconf script to support libnl detection.
	         IPv6 IPVS kernel subsystem is reachable through
	         generic netlink configuration interface.
	* IPv6 : Enhanced libipvs-2.6 to support generic netlink
	         configuration interface. If generic netlink is
	         available with kernel then it will be the
	         prefered path to configure IPVS.
	* IPv6 : Enhanced the whole checker API to use
	         sockaddr_storage.
	* IPv6 : Enhanced the whole core framework to use
	         sockaddr_storage.
	* IPv6 : Enhanced all checkers to use sockaddr_storage.
	* fixed a long time pending issue in all checkers. If
	  first connection attempt to remote peer was failing
	  no more check was performed to service... Up on error
	  connecting remote peer simply register a new timer for
	  next check. This is specially needed in IPv6 context
	  where a unreachable host can be reached at delayed time.
	* code clean-up: revisited the code to use more POSIX
	  compliant declaration. thread typedef to use thread_t
	  instead. revisisted checker framework to use POSIX typdef
	  declaration.

2010-12-08  Alexandre Cassen  <acassen@linux-vs.org>
	* keepalived-1.2.1 released.
	* Vincent Bernat <bernat <at> luffy.cx>:
	  VRRP: Fix incorrect computation for packet size
	* Vincent Bernat <bernat <at> luffy.cx>:
	  VRRP: handle passwords up to 8 characters
	* Vincent Bernat <bernat <at> luffy.cx>:
	  When updating weight, check quorum state.
	  MISC check can update the weight of a real server. This
	  can lead to a change in quorum state.
	  We factor out quorum handling from perform_svr_state()
	  into a new function update_quorum_state() that will check if
	  the quorum state changed and if yes, update sorry server status,
	  exec quorum commands and add back or remove alive real servers
	  (with existing function perform_quorum_state()).
	  This patch is mostly cut'n'paste and adding a call to
	  update_quorum_state() in update_svr_wgt(). We also make
	  perform_svr_state() and update_quorum_state() almost symmetric.
	* Vincent Bernat <bernat <at> luffy.cx>:
	  Fix an infinite loop in master transition with sync groups.
	  This patch is from Arjan Filius. See:
	  http://marc.info/?l=keepalived-devel&m=128212278218825&w=2
	  When transitioning to master state, keepalived might try to
	  force transition to master state of other VRRP instances into
	  the same group before their transition is complete. This leads
	  to an infinite loop with huge VRRP trafic.
	* Vincent Bernat <bernat <at> luffy.cx>:
	  VRRP : Use VRRP_PRIO_DFL instead of 100 for default priority.
	* Vincent Bernat <bernat <at> luffy.cx>:
	  Use netpacket/packet.h instead of linux/if_packet.h to get
	  sockaddr_ll.
	  linux/if_packet.h pulls linux/types.h that should not be used
	  by a userland program since types defined here can conflict
	  with stdint.h. We use netpacket/packet.h which is a GNU LibC
	  header.
	* Vincent Bernat <bernat <at> luffy.cx>:
	  Keep current weight on reload when initial weight is not
	  altered.
	  Weight can be changed by MISC_CHECK when using dynamic option.
	  In case of reload, the change is lost until the script runs
	  again. We record the initial weight in a separate variable and
	  use it to check if a real server has changed instead of using
	  the actual weight.
	* Vincent Bernat <bernat <at> luffy.cx>:
	  VRRP : disabled scripts and initially good scripts should be
	  considered as OK.
	  When a script is not weighted, its failure will lead to a
	  failure of the associated VRRP instance. However, disabled
	  script and scripts that are initially good (after a reload)
	  should be considered as successful and not make the instance
	  fail.  Moreover, a disabled script should not be used when
	  computing script weights.
	* Vincent Bernat <bernat <at> luffy.cx>:
	  VRRP : more informative message when disabling a script due
	  to use of weights.
	  When using a weight for a tracked script, the script is
	  disabled.  However, the warning message said that the weight
	  was ignored. We change the message to tell that the script is
	  ignored. Moreover, we don't change its weight since it can be
	  used in another instance, not in a SYNC group.
	* Vincent Bernat <bernat <at> luffy.cx>:
	  check : include missing virtual server group name in a log
	  message
	* Vincent Bernat <bernat <at> luffy.cx>:
	  configure: add a check for ETHERTYPE_IPV6.
	  ETHERTYPE_IPV6 defined in net/ethernet.h is pretty recent.
	  If absent, we hard-code the value into CFLAGS. This patch
	  requires regeneration of configure.
	* Vincent Bernat <bernat <at> luffy.cx>:
	  check : update server weight in IPVS only if server is alive
	  and in the pool.
	  With inhibit_on_failure, a server can be in the pool and not
	  alive. We don't want to set the weight of an inhibited server
	  or a server in a virtual server whose qorum is not met yet.
	* Vincent Bernat <bernat <at> luffy.cx>:
	  check: really add back inhibited server when quorum is gained
	  A previous change contained an erroneous check to add back
	  alive servers when quorum state was gained. This check was
	  incompatible with inhibit_on_failure. When servers were added
	  back in the pool, the weight was not updated accordingly.
	* Vincent Bernat <bernat <at> luffy.cx>:
	  check : update server weight despite quorum when no sorry
	  server.
	  In absence of a sorry server, the logic is to not use quorum
	  except to run commands when quorum is gained or lost. This
	  means that if a MISC check modifies the weight of a server
	  and there is no sorry server, we do not consider quorum.

2010-05-31  Alexandre Cassen  <acassen@linux-vs.org>
	* Branch 1.2.0 created. This branch will host all new
	  developments on Keepalived. New code will be added
	  in here only.
	* VRRP : Add support to IPv6 protocol. The global framework
	  has been extended to support this branch new family !
	* VRRP : Implement IPv6 Neighbour Discovery protocol (NDISC).
	  In IPv6 gratuitous ARP doesnt exist since ARP is IPv4 only.
	  NDISC can provide the same feature by sending so called
	  Unsolicited Neighbour Advertisement. A node can send such a
	  protocol datagram in order to (unreliable) propagate new
	  information quickly (rfc4861.4.4). NDISC build an ICMPv6
	  message with taget link-layer address option, this option is
	  set icmp6_override flag to indicate that advertisement should
	  override an existing cache entry and update the cached
	  link-layer.
	* VRRP : Extend ip address framework to be IPv4 and IPv6
	  independant. An ip address, as defined in framework, is
	  now {IPv4,broadcast} or {IPv6}. Use struct ifaddrmsg to
	  store and prepare netlink related operation. This clean-
	  -up the code.
	* VRRP : Extend parser to support IPv6 declarations. IPv6
	  and IPv4 addresses can be configured inside the same
	  configuration block (eg: virtual_ipaddress or
	  virtual_ipaddress_excluded). An instance can run IPv4 and
	  IPv6 addresses at a time, this can be useful in dual-stack
	  env (since this will become certainly the most common use
	  case in the next years).
	* VRRP : Extend netlink framwork to support IPv6 addresses
	  interactions (reflection/addition/deletion).
	* VRRP : Extend finite state machine support IPv4 & IPv6
	  at a time.
	* VRRP : Extend protocol helpers to support IPv6 multicast
	  related. AF_INET6 SOCK_RAW tweaking it done through
	  socket API instead of PF_PACKET header building... This
	  makes code cleaner.
	* VRRP : Set default VRRP instance protocol to be IPv4.
	  you can use configuration keyword "native_ipv6" inside
	  vrrp_instance configuration block to specify that you
	  want to use IPv6 for VRRP multicasting protocol instead.
	* VRRP : Extend socket option related helpers to support
	  IPv6 specifics.
	* VRRP : Extend protocol scheduler and dispatcher to
	  support IPv6.
	* VRRP : Extend socket pool to keep track of socket
	  family.
	* VRRP : Cleanup protocol offset pointer by removing
	  duplication code...
	* VRRP : some code clean-up...

2010-05-06  Alexandre Cassen  <acassen@linux-vs.org>
	* keepalived-1.1.20 released.
	* Vincent Bernat <bernat <at> luffy.cx> extended ip/route
	  framework to be able to add route or ip address if they
	  already exist.
	* Vincent Bernat <bernat <at> luffy.cx> fixed broadcast
	  address display.
	* Vincent Bernat <bernat <at> luffy.cx> extended genhash to
	  display an error when giving an incorrect IP address.
	* Vincent Bernat <bernat <at> luffy.cx>: When parsing 
	  "blackhole" route, also parse IP mask.
	* Vincent Bernat <bernat <at> luffy.cx>:
	  On reload, destroy signal pipes before recreating them.
	* Vincent Bernat <bernat <at> luffy.cx>:
	  Fix SMTP checker adding himself repeatedly in the list of
	  failed checkers.
	* Vincent Bernat <bernat <at> luffy.cx>:
	  Handle non-existant default interface in VIP definition.
	* Vincent Bernat <bernat <at> luffy.cx>:
	  Remove alive real servers when quorum is lost.
	* Vincent Bernat <bernat <at> luffy.cx>: 
	  Fix a segfault when a virtual_server is empty.
	* Vincent Bernat <bernat <at> luffy.cx>: 
	  Add real servers to new member of a virtual server group
	  on reload.
	* Vincent Bernat <bernat <at> luffy.cx>: 
	  Keep previous effective VRRP priority on reload.
	* Vincent Bernat <bernat <at> luffy.cx>: 
	  Fix VRRP script not running any more after reload.
	* Vincent Bernat <bernat <at> luffy.cx>: 
	  On reload, keep status for all VRRP scripts.
	* Removed IPVS Kernel 2.2 support

2009-10-01  Alexandre Cassen  <acassen@linux-vs.org>
	* keepalived-1.1.19 released.
	* Cosmetics changes.
	* Vincent Bernat <bernat <at> luffy.cx> fix a segfault
	  when there is no real server for a virtual server.
	* Vincent Bernat <bernat <at> luffy.cx>, Willy Tarreau
	  and I finally fixed SIGCHLD handling upon reload.
	* Vincent Bernat <bernat <at> luffy.cx> fix VS_ISEQ macro.
	* VRRP : Kimitoshi Takahashi <ktaka <at> clustcom.com>
	  fixed nopreempt from FAULT state. The owner of higher
	  priority in FAULT state shouldn't preempt current MASTER
	  when it's recovering, if the nopreempt option is set.

2009-09-24  Alexandre Cassen  <acassen@linux-vs.org>
	* keepalived-1.1.18 released.
	* Fixed compilation warnings
	* Updated autoconf kernel version detection. Created a new
	  configuration option to force kernel versioni selection.
	  This option can be useful for crosscompilation:
	  --with-kernel-version={2.2|2.4|2.6}
	* Updated media link failure detection strategy. Kernel
	  linkwatch has been around for long time so set it as
	  default strategy. Alternatively you can choose to use
	  MII BSMR polling strategy by adding new keyword
	  'vrrp_linkbeat_use_polling' in your configuration file.
	* Vincent Bernat <bernat <at> luffy.cx> fixed ip_vs.h includes.
	* Removed vrrp_running and check_running test since it is
	  already performed by keepalived_running.
	* Properly handle father pidfile handling.
	* fixed reload handler to properly print out PID.
	* Willy and I fixed a signal handling issue while reloading
	  daemon. A dereferencing master thread issue leading to a
	  segfault, so that reload was seen as a restart because it
	  was respawned by keepalived father process.
	* Willy fixed a missing UNSET_RELOAD declaration leading to
	  a potential infinite loop while performing reload.
	* Vincent Bernat <bernat <at> luffy.cx> fixed initial value
	  of quorum state on startup and reload. Fixed sorry server
	  removal to consider quorum state.
	* VRRP : Add missing notify calls while entering FAULT state.
	* VRRP : Willy added support to delayed script check launch
	  (up and down). It defines "rise" and "fall" keywords. "fall"
	  defines the required number of failures to switch in KO mode,
	  "rise" defines the number of sucesses to switch in OK mode.
	* VRRP : Fixed an IP_DROP_MEMBERSHIP issue while performing
	  reload. vrrp socket pool is released at first.

2009-03-05  Alexandre Cassen  <acassen@linux-vs.org>
	* keepalived-1.1.17 released.
	* Fixed low-level scheduler timer computation to take care to
	  monothonic computation. Select returns if timer is null!
	* VRRP : Fixed vrrp script initialization to use event thread
	  instead of timer thread so that script no longer need to
	  wait until first polling timer fired.
	* VRRP : Willy and I fixed MII media link failure detection
	  to test SIOCGMIIREG call before fetching BMSR.
	* VRRP : Resurected VRRP_STATE_GOTO_FAULT. This state is
	  really needed to speed-up convergence and prevent against
	  any issue while using vrrp_sync_group.

2009-02-15  Alexandre Cassen  <acassen@linux-vs.org>
	* keepalived-1.1.16 released.
	* Code clean-up.
	* Stefan Rompf, <stefan@loplof.de> extended scheduler to
	  synchronize signal handling by sending the signal number through
	  a self pipe, making signals select()able. Child reaping has been
	  moved to a simple signal synchronous signal handler. Signal
	  shutdown handling has been centralized.
	* Denis Ovsienko, <pilot@etcnet.org> extended healthchecker
	  framework to support alpha/omega design. It provides virtual
	  service control in a more fine-graned maner. You may have a
	  look to the SYNOPSIS file to have full picture on configation.
	  It addresses the following issues :
	  - A virtual service is considered up even with an empty RS pool.
	  - There is no reliable mean to avoid service regression, when
	    the server pool becomes too small.
	  - There is no mean to escalate any of the above fault/recovery
	    events.
	  - Real servers are assumed alive initially. This leads to
	    unnecessary state flap on keepalived start.
	  - notify_down isn't executed for working real servers on
	    keepalived shutdown.
	  - There is no reliable mean to handle keepalived stop to move
	    the virtual service over another load balancer.
	* Stephan Mayr, <Mayr.Stefan@swm.de> fixed default value for
	  checker loop... a missing TIMER_HZ.
	* Merge keepalived.init.suse.
	* Robin Garner, <robin.garner@scu.edu.au> added support to
	  --log-console facility.
	* Tobias Klausmann, <klausman@schwarzvogel.de> fixed an openfile
	  leak while performing reload.
	* Leo Baltus, <Leo.Baltus@omroep.nl> extended pidfile handling
	  to allow keepalived to start using configurated pidfile.
	* VRRP : Siim Poder, <siim@p6drad-teel.net> fixed IPSEC AH auth
	  to skip IPv4 id field of zero. If zeroed kernel will fill it
	  and lead to an unwanted protocol re-election.
	* VRRP : Siim Poder, <siim@p6drad-teel.net> fixed reloading issue.
	  New ip addresses are added (from configuration). State is kept
	  instead of starting from whatever is in configuration file.
	  If prios are changed in such a way, state change can occur after
	  reload.
	* VRRP : Vincent Bernat, <bernat@luffy.cx> extended virtual_route
	  to support virtual "black hole" route as well as multihop route.
	* VRRP : Stig Thormodsrud, <stig@vyatta.com> fixed a crash while
	  using virtual_router_id set to 255.
	* VRRP: Jon DeVree, <jadevree@arbor.net> fixed arp handling to
	  to initialize the target hardware address, using 0xff as found
	  in arping. Let scripts work without dealing with weight, if the
	  script fails, VRRP fails.
	* VRRP : Pierre-Yves Ritschard, <pierre-yves@spootnik.org> removed
	  the GOTO_FAULT state from FSM.
	* VRRP : Willy Tarreau, <w@1wt.eu> fixed link detection handling
	  to support right ioctl values for recent kernel ! It can lead
	  to issue while running instance on a bonding interface.
	* VRRP : Willy Tarreau, <w@1wt.eu> extended scheduler to catch
	  time drift. It implements an internal monotonic clock. It
	  maintains an offset between sysclock and monotonic clock, if
	  computed time if anterior to monotonic time then just update
	  offset. If time computed if fare away into the future then
	  limit delay and recompute offset.
	* VRRP : Willy Tarreau, <w@1wt.eu> fixed autoconf issues.

2007-09-15  Alexandre Cassen  <acassen@linux-vs.org>
	* keepalived-1.1.15 released.
	* Matthias Saou, <matthias at rpmforge.net> fixed genhash
	  Makefile for man page installation.
	* Casey Zacek, <keepalived at bogleg.org> provided a patch
	  to check_http to remove buffer minimization while processing
	  stream. It appears some webserver cause healthchecker crash.
	* Chris Marchesi, <chris.marchesi at canadawebhosting.com> provided
	  a patch for better handling of SSL handshake errors.
	* Shinji Tanaka, <stanaka at hatena.ne.jp> fixed parser "include" 
	  directive to support declaration inside configuration directives,
	  like including file inside vrrp_instance declaration.
	* Andreas Kotes, <count at flatline.de> fixed HTTP healthchecker
	  while handling MD5SUM result. It appears checker never removed
	  realserver on MD5SUM mismatch !!! whats that crap.
	* VRRP : Willy Tarreau, <w at 1wt.eu> fixed a missing notifications
	  upon transition from fault to backup.
	* VRRP : Add support to route metric in virtual_routes definition.
	
2007-09-13  Alexandre Cassen  <acassen@linux-vs.org>
	* keepalived-1.1.14 released.
	* Shinji Tanaka, <stanaka at hatena.ne.jp> extended parsing
	  framework to support "include" directives. For more
	  informations and documentation please refer to Shinji
	  website : 
	    http://misccs.dyndns.org/index.php?keepalived%20include%20patch
	* Tobias Klausmann, <klausman at schwarzvogel.de> add error loggin
	  while parsing configuration file.
	* Merged patches from rpmforge.net on Makefile and redhat specfile.
	* Create a goodies directory to store nice scripts received from
	  users. Add Steve Milton (milton AT isomedia.com) arpreset script
	  to delete a single ARP entry from a CISCO router.
	* VRRP : David Woodhouse, <dwmw2 at redhat.com> fixed vrrp_arp
	  includes.
	* VRRP : Pierre-Yves Ritschard, <pyr at spootnik.org> fixed negative
	  weights in script.
	* VRRP : Michael Smith, <msmith at cbnco.com> extended
	  virtual_ipaddress setting to support Old-style Linux interface
	  aliases like eth0:1.
	* VRRP : Ward Wouts, <ward.wouts at gmail.com> add support to 
	  vrrp_script logging.

2006-10-11  Alexandre Cassen  <acassen@linux-vs.org>
	* keepalived-1.1.13 released.
	* VRRP : Added a new notify script to be launch during vrrp
	  instances shutdown. This new notify hook is configured
	  using notify_stop keyword inside vrrp_instance block.
	* VRRP : Willy Tarreau <w at 1wt.eu> fixed an errno issue in
	  thread_fetch(), errno is lost during set_time_now(). This
	  patch saves it across the call to set_time_now() in order
	  to get the valid error.
	* VRRP : Willy Tarreau <w at 1wt.eu> extended timer framework
	  to save errno in timer_now() and set_time_now() just in
	  case other functions do not expect these functions to modify
	  it. This is a safer approach than the initial patch to
	  thread_fetch(), while still compatible.
	* VRRP : Willy Tarreau <w at 1wt.eu> fixed an FSM silent issue.
	  By default, the VRRP daemon stops sending during new MASTER
	  elections. This causes 3 to 4 seconds of silence depending on
	  the local priority, and sometimes causes flapping when the
	  differences in priorities are very low, due to the kernel timer's
	  resolution : sometimes, the old master receives a first
	  advertisement, enters backup, waits 3 seconds, sees nothing and
	  finally becomes master again, which forces a new reelection on
	  the other one.
	* VRRP : Willy Tarreau <w at 1wt.eu> extended VRRP framework to
	  support floating priority. Replace the priority in each
	  vrrp_instance with a base priority and an effective priority,
	  to prepare the support for floating priorities. The configuration
	  sets the base_priority, and all comparisons use the new
	  effective_priority value. This one is computed in the
	  vrrp_update_priority() thread by adding an offset to base_priority,
	  based on the result of various checks.
	* VRRP : Willy Tarreau <w at 1wt.eu> extended notify script to add
	  the priority in "$4" when calling a notify script. This is
	  important in labs and datacenters when systems can display the
	  priority on a front LCD, because it allows workers to carefully
	  operate without causing unexpected reelections.
	* VRRP : Willy Tarreau <w at 1wt.eu> extended interface tracking
	  framework to let interface tracking change the priority by adding
	  a "weight" parameter. If the weight is positive, it will be added
	  to the priority when the interface is UP. If the weight is negative,
	  it will be subtracted from the priority when the interface is down.
	  If the weight is zero (default), a down interface will switch the
	  instance to the FAULT state.
	* VRRP : Willy Tarreau <w at 1wt.eu> added a new "vrrp_script" section
	  to monitor local processes or do any type of local processing to
	  decide whether the machine is in good enough health to be elected
	  as master. A same script will be run once for all instances which
	  monitor it. If no instance use it, it will not be run, so that it's
	  safe to declare a lot of useful scripts. A weight is associated to
	  the script result. If the weight is positive, it will be added to
	  the priority when the result is OK (exit 0). If the weight is
	  negative, it will be subtracted from the priority when the result
	  is KO (exit != 0). If the weight is zero, the script will not be
	  monitored. The default value is 2.
	* VRRP : Willy Tarreau <w at 1wt.eu> extended vrrp scheduler so that
	  when a VRRP is part of a SYNC group, it must not use floating
	  priorities, otherwise this may lead to infinite re-election after
	  every advertisement because some VRRPs will announce higher prios
	  than the peer, while others will announce lower prios. The solution
	  is to set all weights to 0 to enable standard interface tracking,
	  and to disable the update prio thread if VRRP SYNC is enabled on a
	  VRRP.
	* VRRP : Willy Tarreau <w at 1wt.eu> added some documentation and
	  examples for the brand new VRRP tracking mechanisms.
	* VRRP : Ranko Zivojnovic, <ranko at spidernet.net> fixed vrrp
	  scheduler to execute notify* scripts in transition from the
	  failed state to the backup state.
	* Nick Couchman, <nick.couchman at seakr.com>, added support for
	  real server upper and lower thresholds.  This allows you to set
	  a minimum and maximum number of connections to each real server
	  using the "uthreshold" (maximum) and "lthreshold" (minimum)
	  options in the real_server section of the configuration file.
	* Chris Caputo, <ccaputo at alt.net> extended autoconf script
	  to support recent move of UTS_RELEASE from linux/version.h to
	  linux/utsrelease.h.
	* Chris Caputo, <ccaputo at alt.net> extended ipvswrapper 2.4
	  code to support misc_dynamic weight.

2006-03-09  Alexandre Cassen  <acassen@linux-vs.org>
	* keepalived-1.1.12 released.
	* VRRP : Christophe Varoqui, <Christophe.Varoqui@free.fr> extended
	  VRRP framework to use virtual_router_id as syncid in LVS mcast
	  datagram while using LVS syncd in VRRP instance.
	* Kevin Lindsay, <kevinl@netnation.com> and Christophe Varoqui,
	  <Christophe.Varoqui@free.fr> fixed SSL checker to properly
	  use openssl when dealing with asynchronous stream handling.
	  Kevin fixed asynchronous handling during connection stage
	  while Christophe fixed stream handling after connection stage.
	* Kjetil Torgrim Homme, <kjetilho@ifi.uio.no> extended keepalived
	  spec file to cleanly compile on RedHat enterprise 3 and 4.
	* Heinz Knutzen, <Heinz.Knutzen@dataport.de> fixed SMTP checker
	  to overwrite default_host while parsing configuration file.
	  A SMTP_CHECK without a "host" section should use the ip of the
	  current real server as default.

2005-03-01  Alexandre Cassen  <acassen@linux-vs.org>
	* keepalived-1.1.11 released.
	* Asier Llano Palacios, <a.llano@usyscom.com> extended
	  autoconf script to support cross-compilation.
	* Kevin Lindsay, <kevinl@netnation.com> and I fixed a
	  missing bitwise negation while removing signal from
	  global signal mask. Set this operation before handler
	  is called. This assume that bitwise negation is an
	  atomic code generated from compiler. Since gcc 3.3
	  this is true.
	* VRRP : extended ipaddress and iproutes code to return
	  if vip or vroutes is referencing an unknown interface.

2005-02-15  Alexandre Cassen  <acassen@linux-vs.org>
	* keepalived-1.1.10 released.
	* VRRP : While restoring interface, release iproutes
	  before ipaddresses. Routing daemons needs that order
	  for netlink reflection channel.
	* VRRP : Bin Guo, <bguo@bluesocket.com> fixed a memory
	  leak while calling script_open.
	* Kevin Lindsay, <kevinl@netnation.com> fixed some buffer
	  overruns, NULL pointer and dangling pointer references.
	* Kevin Lindsay, <kevinl@netnation.com> redisigned signal
	  handling. When a signal occurs, a global signal_mask is
	  modified. In the main loop there is a checked to see if
	  the signal_mask has any pending signals. The appropriate
	  signal handler is then run at this time. This is to prevent
	  races when modifying linked lists.
	* Kevin Lindsay, <kevinl@netnation.com> fixed shadowed
	  declarations.
	* Christophe Varoqui, <Christophe.Varoqui@free.fr> and I
	  Extended libipvs-2.6 to support syncd zombies handling.
	  Since ip_vs_sync.c kernel code no longer handle waitpid()
	  we fork a child before any ipvs syncd operation in order
	  to workaround zombies generation.
	* John Ferlito, <johnf@inodes.org> and I Fixed a scheduling
	  race condition while working with low timers.
	* Updated check_http and check_ssl to use non-blocking
	  socket.
	* Fixed some race conditions while reloading configuration.
	  Prevent against list gardening if list is empty !
	* Fixed recursive configuration parsing function to be clean
	  with stack. Only one recursion level.
	* Some cosmetics cleanup in Makefiles.

2005-02-07  Alexandre Cassen  <acassen@linux-vs.org>
	* keepalived-1.1.9 released.
	* VRRP : Chris Caputo, <ccaputo@alt.net> updated keepalived manpage
	  for nopreempt and preempt_delay.
	* VRRP : Fixed an issue while releasing vrrp socket pool... Just
	  release pool one time !
	* VRRP : Fixed netlink framework to properly save netlink socket flags
	  while setting blocking flags.
	* VRRP : Fixed a regression introduced with previous release while
	  hashing vrrp fd bucket into fd hash index.
	* Patrick Boutilier, <boutilpj@ednet.ns.ca> fixed an issue in the
	  extract_html function. Read the full html header.
	* Chris Caputo, <ccaputo@alt.net> and I fixed compilation issue
	  while using --enable-debug configuration option.
	* Extended both VRRP and Healthchecker framework to support
	  debugging flags.
	* Removed the watchdog framework. Since scheduling framework
	  support child, we register a child thread for both process
	  VRRP & Healthcheck. When child die or stop prematuraly this
	  launch scheduling callback previously registered. Watchdog
	  is now handled by signaling.
	  (credit goes to Kevin Lindsay, <kevinl@netnation.com> for nice
	  idea).
	* Some cosmetics cleanup.

2005-01-25  Alexandre Cassen  <acassen@linux-vs.org>
	* keepalived-1.1.8 released.
	* VRRP : Chris Caputo, <ccaputo@alt.net> added "dont_track_primary"
	  vrrp_instance keyword which tells keepalived to ignore VRRP
	  interface faults. Can be useful on setup where two routers
	  are connected directly to each other on the interface used
	  for VRRP.  Without this feature the link down caused
	  by one router crashing would also inspire the other router to lose
	  (or not gain) MASTER state, since it was also tracking link status.
	* VRRP : Chris Caputo, <ccaputo@alt.net> added "nopreempt" which
	  overrides the VRRP RFC preemption default. This replaces the
	  "preempt" keyword which was not fully implemented. "preempt" is
	  kept around for backward compatibility but is deprecated.
	* VRRP : Chris Caputo, <ccaputo@alt.net> added "preempt_delay" which
	  allows one to specify number of seconds after startup until VRRP
	  preemption.  (range 0 to 1,000 seconds) this is useful because
	  sometimes when a machine recovers it takes a while for it to become
	  usable, such as when it is a router and BGP sessions need to come
	  back up.
	* Chris Caputo, <ccaputo@alt.net> made it so there is a useful "Date:"
	  in SMTP alert emails.
	* VRRP : Chris Caputo, <ccaputo@alt.net>. In debug output log
	  gratuitous ARPs with actual IP addresses being ARPed.
	* VRRP : Chris Caputo, <ccaputo@alt.net>. If started with
	  "--dont-release-vrrp" then try to remove addresses even if we didn't
	  add them during the current run, when it makes sense to do so.
	* VRRP : Chris Caputo, <ccaputo@alt.net> added a missing
	  free_vrrp_buffer() during VRRP stop.
	* VRRP : Kees Bos, <k.bos@zx.nl> fixed VRRP sanity check to perform
	  checksum computation over incoming packet and not local router
	  instance memory representation => Better to log 'invalid vip
	  count' instead of 'Invalid vrrp checksum' when the number of
	  configured vips differ in the master and backup server :)
	* VRRP : Release socket pool during daemon stop and reload
	* VRRP : Refresh socket pool during reload
	* VRRP : Extended netlink framework to support blocking
	  operation. During initialization, set blocking netlink channel
	  to wait responses from kernel while parsing result. Kernel netlink
	  reflection are still handled using non-blocking.
	* Jeremy Rumpf, <rumpf.6@osu.edu> added SMTP checker. It take
	  a special care of smtp server return code.
	* Merged genhash man page
	* Chris Caputo, <ccaputo@alt.net> added "misc_dynamic" to a
	  MISC_CHECK which makes it so a script can adjust the weight of
	  a real server.
	* Fixed some assertion issue in memory framework.
	* Use router_id instead of lvs_id in the global_def configuration
	  block (lvs_id kept for backward compatibility).
	* Ronald Wahl <rwa@peppercon.com>, fixed declarations to be only
	  in includes files.
	* Ronald Wahl <rwa@peppercon.com>, moved the definition of variables
	  to C files
	* Ronald Wahl <rwa@peppercon.com> and I fixed scanning for header/body
	  separator in HTTP protocol 
	* Ronald Wahl <rwa@peppercon.com> replaced memcpy by memmove where source
	  & destination may overlap
	* Extended checker API to only register checkers when checker callback
	  is defined.
	* Jacob Rief, <jacob.rief@tiscover.com> fixed openlog to take care
	  of configured log facility.
	* Move in_csum to util file.
	* Extended libraries to support some new facilities (list and vector).
	* Extended scheduler I/O to use timer decalred on the stack.
	* Some cosmetics changes.

2004-04-05  Alexandre Cassen  <acassen@linux-vs.org>
	* keepalived-1.1.7 released.
	* Jacob Rief, <jacob.rief@tiscover.com> added target tarball into
	  root Makefile to facilitate packaging (rpm & tarball).
	* Jacob Rief, <jacob.rief@tiscover.com> and I unified version
	  handling. Now only the root file VERSION is used by configure
	  to add VERSION_STRING via config.h.in. Added VERSION_DATE
	  included into the VERSION_STRING that reflect the building
	  date into the version banner.
	* Andres Salomon, <dilinger@voxel.net> wrote the genhash manpage.
	* VRRP : Added ipvs_start() and ipvs_stop() calls during vrrp child
	  start and stop stage.
	* Added some assertion test in memory framework to not allocate
	  bucket if no more place. This option is only used if compiled
	  with debug flags.
	* Some cosmetics patch in Makefiles and autoconf script.

2004-02-23  Alexandre Cassen  <acassen@linux-vs.org>
	* keepalived-1.1.6 released.
	* VRRP : Fixed scheduling timer update. Global scheduling timer is
	  updated before each thread registering and after scheduling I/O MUX.
	  Since is needed to take care of scheduling jitter introduced by
	  overhead (VRRP is using low low timer so more sensitive to overhead).
	  Thanks to Nathan Neulinger, <nneul@umr.edu> for his quick feedback
	  debugging time.
	* VRRP : Nathan Neulinger, <nneul@umr.edu> updated vrrp dropping
	  strategy to not reply to incoming bogus adverts. Since this can
	  introduce flooding loop, bogus adverts are now simply silently
	  dropped.
	* VRRP : Fixed a linkbeat issue while polling NIC flags.
	* Updated autoconf and Makefile to support 2.6 kernel IPVS code. For
	  code readability, created 2 differents libipvs for 2.4 and 2.6 kernel
	  . Fixed autoconf generated warning.
	* Extended ipvswrapper to support shared buffer user rule. This
	  increase performances by limiting memory allocation. OTOH, created
	  two new ipvs helpers ipvs_start & ipvs_stop to initialize ipvs
	  subsystem.
	* Andres Salomon, <dilinger@voxel.net> made some cosmetics update
	  in Makefiles to support $(DESTDIR) and $(BIN)/$(EXEC) path split.

2004-01-25  Alexandre Cassen  <acassen@linux-vs.org>
	* keepalived-1.1.5 released.
	* Joseph Mack, <mack.joseph@epa.gov> wrote keeplived manpages
	  in doc/man/man5/keepalived.conf.5 and doc/man/man8/keepalived.8.
	* VRRP : Tsuji Akira, <tsuji@centurysys.co.jp> fixed a length
	  issue while testing password field for auth_pass method.
	* VRRP : Willy Tarreau, <willy@w.ods.org> fixed a quick loop
	  in the watchdog timer thread.
	* VRRP : Willy Tarreau, <willy@w.ods.org> extended scheduler
	  to support stable scheduling time. There is now, only one
	  time source updated before and after scheduling event. This
	  solve sliding timer observed on some env, also known as
	  periodically flapping issue (sometime a VRRP election is
	  forced).
	* VRRP : Willy Tarreau, <willy@w.ods.org> updated the default
	  media link failure detection strategy to perform a ioctl
	  ifflags even if NIC driver are supporting MII or ETHTOOL.
	  Some buggy drivers need this. Anyway the linkwatch patch
	  still the best solution to support efficient and scalable
	  media link failure detection.
	* Some cosmetics clean-up, removed some dead files, updated
	  autoconf and Makefile prototypes to support dependencies
	  libs like kerberos for RedHat/Fedora distro. To compile
	  keepalived properly on redhat 9 box, for example, run :
	  export CPPFLAGS="-I/usr/kerberos/include" && ./configure
	  Renamed keywords lb_kind to lvs_method and ld_algo to
	  lvs_sched. For compatibility reasons, old keywords are still
	  available.

2003-12-29  Alexandre Cassen  <acassen@linux-vs.org>
	* keepalived-1.1.4 released.
	* Refresh autoconf script to use autoconf 2.5.
	* Extended the autoconf script to support linkwatch kernel
	  detection.
	* To work-around the SMP forking bug, added support to two
	  new daemon starting options :
	  --vrrp               -P    Only run with VRRP subsystem.
	  --check              -C    Only run with Health-checker
	                             subsystem.
	  Those options extend daemon design to support VRRP &
	  heathchecking subsystem selection. You can now run
	  two Keepalived daemon one invoqued with --vrrp and
	  the other with --check. That way we workaround the
	  forking issue by running one daemon per subsystem.
	* Tiddy cleanup in the daemon code.
	* VRRP : Extended the link media failure detection to support
	  asynchronous NIC MII polling. The design use now, one
	  dedicated polling thread per NIC. This reduce scheduling
	  jitter by this way.
	* VRRP : Added support to kernel linkwatch subsystem. This
	  patch that you will find a copy on the Keepalived website
	  for the kernel 2.4 branch, provides kernel netlink broadcast
	  events drived by NIC link media state event. That way
	  we move from a polling design to an event design. Link
	  events are received throught a kernel netlink broadcast
	  socket in the userspace land. So, NIC media link failure
	  detection is now provided by kernel netlink reflection.
	  You can read the paper attached with the patch for
	  indepth explanations.
	* VRRP : fixed timer computation to prevent against negative
	  value.

2003-09-29  Alexandre Cassen  <acassen@linux-vs.org>
	* keepalived-1.1.3 released.
	* Stephan von Krawczynski, <skraw@ithnet.com> extended ip
	  address framework to support broadcast address selection.
	* Extended the scheduling framework to support plain 'long' 
	  timer. Visited the layer4 framework to support this new
	  scheduling scheme. Reviewed the checkers and VRRP framework
	  to support long timer.
	* VRRP : Removed the timer micro adjust call. Its use is
	  obsolete with the new scheduling 'long' timer support.
	* Jacob Rief, <Jacob.Rief@tiscover.com> and I added support
	  log level selection for main daemon. A new command line
	  argument has been created :
	  --log-facility  -S  0-7 Set syslog facility to
	                      LOG_LOCAL[0-7]. (default=LOG_DAEMON)
	* Extended the HTTP checker to support non blocking read
	  while processing stream. NONBLOCK flags is set before
	  read operation to catch EAGAIN error.
	* VRRP : Diego Rivera, <lrivera@racsa.co.cr> and I fixed a
	  notify issue while building notify exec string.
	* VRRP : Diego Rivera, <lrivera@racsa.co.cr> and I extended
	  FSM to support BACKUP state notifiers and smtp_alert call
	  during VRRP initialization.
	* Jan Vanhercke, <jan.vanhercke@c-cure.be> and I extended
	  scheduling timer computation to support micro-sec second
	  overlap. Extended the whole scheduling framework to support
	  this scheduling scheme while computing thread timers.
	* Fixed scheduling framework to support child thread timers
	  while computing global scheduling timer.

2003-09-07  Alexandre Cassen  <acassen@linux-vs.org>
	* keepalived-1.1.2 released.
	* Dominik Vogt, <dominik.vogt@gmx.de> and I extended checker
	  framework to support multiple checkers per realserver.
	  Each checker own a uniq id, each realserver own a list
	  of checkers id. Realserver is considered down if one of the
	  checkers fails.
	* Dominik Vogt, <dominik.vogt@gmx.de> extended list library to
	  support free_list_element.
	* Dominik Vogt, <dominik.vogt@gmx.de> and I extended ipwrapper
	  to support multiple checkers test. Created a checker state
	  updater helper function to perform realserver state according
	  to checker state.
	* Dominik Vogt, <dominik.vogt@gmx.de> extended all checkers
	  code to support multiple checker design (to not perform
	  server state according a single checkers test).
	* Tobias Klausmann, <klausman@schwarzvogel.de> and I extended
	  layer4 framework to support socket binding to a specific
	  ip address before calling connect(). Extended the TCP, HTTP
	  and SSL checker to support binding selection, creating
	  a new checker keyword named "bindto".
	  look at doc/keepalived.conf.SYNOPSIS for more informations.
	* VRRP : Extended the ethtool code to be selected only if
	  ETHTOOL_GLINK is available. This is useful for s/390 zSeries
	  users :) since zSerie 2.4 kernel doesn't support ethtool
	  extension.
	* VRRP : Gatis Peisenieks, <gatis@mt.lv> fixed IPSEC-AH
	  code to exclude ip header id filed while computing AH digest.
	  Fixed AH sequence number to be set in network byte order.
	* VRRP : Fixed a bug in the static_ipaddress block that caused
	  a noisy crashing startup.
	* VRRP : Kjetil Torgrim Homme, <kjetilho@ifi.uio.no> and I
	  fixed a daemon crash while reloading configuration due to a
	  vrrp_buffer not freed.
	* VRRP : Review the watchdog calling location. watchdog listener
	  is reinitialized during a daemon reload.
	* VRRP : Diego Rivera, <lrivera@racsa.co.cr> extended notify
	  framework to support simple notify script call. Created a new
	  keyword "notify", for both vrrp_instance and vrrp_sync_group.
	  If configured, this notify script is called after FSM state
	  transition notify scripts.
	  look at doc/keepalived.conf.SYNOPSIS for more informations.
	* Review the checker watchdog calling location like VRRP.
	* Fixed code selection to exclude VRRP dependencies if code is
	  configured without VRRP framework.
	* Extended memory lib free function to reset memory location to
	  NULL.
	* Diego Rivera, <lrivera@racsa.co.cr> extended global parser
	  to support default handlers for lvs_id, smtp_server,
	  smtp_connection_timeout and email_from. default values are :
	   o lvs_id : box local name
	   o smtp_server : localhost
	   o email_from : uid@box_local_name
	   o smtp_connection_timeout : 30s

2003-07-24  Alexandre Cassen  <acassen@linux-vs.org>
	* keepalived-1.1.1 released.
	* VRRP : Fixed an issue while reloading configuration. Fixed
	  a dereferencing pointer.
	* Fixed misc checker to perform server state according to 
	  checker result !!!

2003-07-22  Alexandre Cassen  <acassen@linux-vs.org>
	* keepalived-1.1.0 released.
	* The release focus is : "High Performance"
	* Name cleanup for the healthchecking directory. use check 
	  instead of healthcheck to be in conformance with watchdog and 
	  global software architecture.
	* updated the SYNOPSIS file for documenting the table arg inside
	  virtual/static_routes declaration. You can set routes refering
	  to a specific TABLE-ID.
	* Added a dummy debug var in the genhash declaration code to
	  support compilation when compilation is done with debug flag.
	* Added a set flag inside the real_server declaration correctly
	  relfect the IPVS topology when inhibit_on_failure is used.
	* fixed a daemon.h include depandency on signal.h
	* VRRP : Added support to a global shared buffer for incoming
	  advert handling. A new buffer is no longer allocated each time
	  processing incoming advert, instead a shared room is used.
	* VRRP : Added support to pre-allocated shared buffer for 
	  outgoing adverts. Each vrrp instance use a 'one time'
	  allocated buffer instead of a 'all time' one.
	* VRRP : Extended the socket pool design to support shared fd
	  for the outbound channel. Now, socket pool create a sending
	  socket and affect the fd returned to vrrp instances. This
	  forces instances to use a shared socket instead of creating
	  new socket for each outgoing adverts. The error detection
	  is based on the incoming socket, so that outgoing socket is
	  not created as long as incoming socket can not be created.
	* Added support to netlink ipaddress as global keyword
	  "static_ipaddress".
	  look at doc/samples/keepalived.conf.static_ipaddress.
	  IP addresses specified into this block will be added during
	  daemon bootstrap and removed during daemon shutdown. 
	  Differential conf parsing is enabled for this block, 
	  removing/adding static_ipaddress can be done on the fly 
	  sending SIGHUP signal to daemon.
	* VRRP : Extended track_interface to support multiple interface
	  tracking. For those familiar with Nokia monitored circuit, 
	  this extention provide the same functionality.
	  look at doc/samples/keepalived.conf.track_interface.
	* VRRP : The VRRP instance lookup framework has been extended
	  to use a o(1) scheduling design. Rewrote the whole instance
	  lookup to use o(1) lookup instead of previous o(n^2). When
	  receiving incoming adverts vrrp_scheduler performs a lookup
	  over the VRID received to get local instance representation.
	  Since the internal instance representation is an non-sorted
	  linked list, then we run a lookup at o(n^2) complexity that
	  introduce lantency and scheduling jitter side effect when
	  runing large number of instances. To avoid this limitation
	  a static hash table of 255 buckets were created. Since
	  lookup is performed over VRID and since VRID is 8bit fixed,
	  then the hashkey will be VRID. In order to extend code the
	  hashkey is based on incoming fd too. Internally, a NIC is
	  represented by a 2 fds : sending socket and receiving socket.
	  Those fds are NIC specific so we are using them as a hash
	  table lookup collision resolver. With this design we can now
	  use the same VRID on different NICs. The collision design
	  is a linked list so lookup is o(n^2) but due to low number
	  of entries we can consider o(1) speed. But to reach best
	  perf, differents VRID on all instance must be used. The
	  design can be sumed by :

          VRID hash table :

             +---+---+---+---+---+---+.........+-----+
             | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 |.........| 255 |
             +---+---+---+---+---+---+.........+-----+
                   |       |
                 +---+   +---+
                 |fd3|   |fd1|
                 +---+   +---+
                           |
                         +---+
                         |fd5|
                         +---+ 

	  This hash table is filled during configuration parsing and
	  VRRP instances are not duplicated but dynamically pointed
	  to optimize memory.
	* VRRP : The VRRP synchronization group lookup has been 
	  extended. During bootstrap a VRRP instance index is built upon
	  sync_group instance name. This extension speed up 
	  synchronization since while synchronizing it perfoms the 
	  instance index instead of lookup by instance_name. The 
	  previous synchornization code has been rewritten to use this 
	  'list visiting' design for FAULT/BACKUP/MASTER states 
	  synchronization.
	* VRRP : Optimized the vrrp_timer_vrid_timeout(...) to speed
	  up vrid lookup over timeouted fd using a one pass lookup.
	* Bradley Baetz, <bradley.baetz@optusnet.com.au> extended
	  the scheduler framework to support child process handling.
	  Adding support to new thread child facility for handling
	  child processes, and modifying the scheduling select
	  loop & signal handling to catch SIGCHLD, and call the
	  appropriate process.
	* Bradley Baetz, <bradley.baetz@optusnet.com.au> fixed
	  the misc_check healthchecker using new thread child
	  scheduling facility. Introduced a new keyword
	  "misc_timeout" to kill processes which take too long
	  time (default is delay_loop). SIGKILL is send to processes
	  if they take too long time to shutdown.
	* Bradley Baetz, <bradley.baetz@optusnet.com.au> extended
	  daemon framework to block SIGCHLD to only receive it
	  whn its unblocked in the scheduling loop.
	* Extended healthchecker delay_loop to support long
	  delay (ie: >1000s).
	* VRRP : Added support to a shared kernel netlink command
	  channel for setting ip address and routes.
	* Extended the genhash code to support verbose output
	  selection. command arg '-v' will generate a very verbose
	  output.
	* VRRP : Extended the logging code to select verbose log
	  output or not. This selection is done by passing the
	  '-D' option to command line while starting daemon.
	  By default the output is silent.
	* VRRP : Extended the gratuitous ARP framework to support
	  shared buffer and shared socket. This increase performances
	  for instances owning a bunch of VIP.
	* VRRP : Extended the scheduling timer computation to support
	  timer auto-recalibrating. While computing next instance
	  timer, the scheduler will substract the time taken by
	  previous advert handling. This provide software overhead
	  adaptation. The recalibration is performed over usec timer
	  to not pertube global scheduler.
	* VRRP : Fixed a gratuitous ARP issue. Extended the
	  ipaddress framework to point directly to interface
	  reflected by netlink channel instead of storing device
	  index. Extended the gratuitous ARP code to use new
	  ipaddress structure and for sending garp over device
	  ipaddess belong to. Needed if you run an instance on
	  one device interface and set VRRP VIP on different
	  interface.
	* Extended watchdog framework to support polling delay
	  selection via daemon command line. Created two new
	  cmdline options :
	       --wdog-vrrp  -R  Define VRRP watchdog polling
	                        delay. (default=5s)
               --wdog-check -H  Define checkers watchdog
	                        polling delay. (default=5s)
	* Extended SMTP code to support bigger buffer while
	  processing remote mta messages.
	* Erik Barker, <erikb@netnation.com> extended initscript
	  to support native redhat init functions.
	* Extended the autoconf scripts and Makefile(s) to support
	  code profiling. New configure option : --enable-profile
	* list library has been extended to support multi-sized list &
	  specific element deletion. Extended to return when list is
	  empty. This reduce duplicated code to test is list is empty
	  while processing.
	* VRRP : Extended VRRP scheduler to support fd hash
	  table design. Speed up instance lookup while
	  computing instance sands. This offer o(1) design
	  if we consider limited number of instances per
	  device.
	* VRRP : Extended vrrp new socket creation to replace
	  refreshed instance fd into fd hash table index.
	* VRRP : Extended vrrp framework to support
	  blank virtual_ipaddress block, can be usefull
	  if someone want to use just the VRRP advert
	  as hello monitoring channel.
	* Some code cleaning.

2003-05-12  Alexandre Cassen  <acassen@linux-vs.org>
	* keepalived-1.0.3 released.
	* This release has been sponsorized by :
	  Tiscover AG, <www.tiscover.com>
	  Please visit sponsor homepage. I would just like to thanks their IT
	  team for interresting design discussions and testing time, especially
	  Jacob Rief.
	* This release consist of a major daemon re-design to increase security
	  and availability of Keepalived. The daemon has been splitted into 3
	  distinct process. The global design is based on a minimalistic
	  parent process responsible for monitoring its forked children process.
	  Then 2 children process, one responsible for VRRP framework and the
	  other for healthchecking. Each children process has its own scheduling
	  I/O multiplexer, that way VRRP scheduling jitter is optimized since
	  VRRP scheduling must be more sensible than healthcheckers. On the other
	  hand this splitted design minimalize for healthchecking the usage of
	  foreign librairies and minimalize its own action down to and idle
	  mainloop in order to avoid malfunctions caused by itself. The parent
	  process monitoring framework has been called watchdog, the design is :
	  each children process open an accept unix domain socket, then while
	  daemon bootstrap, parent process connect to those unix domain socket
	  and send periodic (5s) hello packets to children. If parent cannot send
	  hello packet to remote connected unix domain socket it simply restart
	  children process. This watchdog design offer 2 benefit, first of all
	  hello packets sent from parent process to remote connected children
	  is done throught I/O multiplexer scheduler that way it can detect
	  deadloop in the children scheduling framework. The second benefit
	  is brought by the uses of sysV signal to detect dead children.
	  When running you will see in process list :
	    PID
	    111  keepalived	<-- parent process monitoring child activity
	    112   \_ keepalived	<-- VRRP children
	    113   \_ keepalived <-- Healthchecking children

	* Parent : Created a global data and global keyword parser structure.
	* Healthcheck framework : Defined check_conf_data to handle related
	  checker data structures. Created specific checker framework parser.
	* VRRP framework : Defined vrrp_conf_data to handle related vrrp
	  data structures. Created specific vrrp framework parser.
	* Each child process has its own syslog facility. VRRP use LOG_LOCAL1
	  and Healthchecker LOG_LOCAL2. To split log you can so configure your
	  syslog to log both facilities in a different logfile.
	* Modularized the configuration parser to limit code duplication.
	* Created modularized software watchdog.
	* Extended the recursive stream parser to use sublevel detection while
	  stream processing. Used to skip end-of-block handling if still at
	  keyword root level to prevent against end parsing if unknown block
	  is parsed.
	* Extended pidfile framework to be more generic.
	* Extended memory framework to log specific child data.
	* Fixed a virtual_server_group issue while healthchecker bringing back
	  real_servers. Modularized virtual_server_group API.
	* Fixed a virtual_server_group issue will reloading configuration.
	  Remove vsgname test from the VS_ISEQ macro. strcmp(...) comparing
	  null pointer... this must have been done in libc :)
	* ipwrapper : set alive flag after ipvs_cmd(...) has been performed.
	* VRRP : Extended the netlink framework to support SCOPE selection for
	  both ipaddress and routes fonctionnalities. SCOPE available are
	  site, link, host, nowhere & global. Default value is set to global.
	  look at doc/keepalived.conf.SYNOPSIS for more informations.
	* Renamed doc/samples/keepalived.conf.routes to
	  doc/samples/keepalived.conf.vrrp.routes.
	* Updated Makefile include dependencies.

2003-04-14  Alexandre Cassen  <acassen@linux-vs.org>
	* keepalived-1.0.2 released.
	* This release has been sponsorized by :
	  edNET, <www.ednet.co.uk>
	  Please visit sponsor homepage and thanks to them for supporting
	  keepalived project.
	* Added support to virtual_server_group so that a virtual_server
	  can be either an IP:PORT, a fwmark or group. A group is a set
	  of virtual_server IP:PORT, IP range and fwmark. So, now a
	  real_server can be part of multiple virtual_server without launching
	  multiple time the same healthchecker that finaly flood real_server.
	  This extension is useful for big ISP/ASP configuration using many
	  virtual_server.
	  look at doc/samples/keepalived.conf.virtual_server_group.
	* Extended differential configuration parser to support diff
	  virtual_server_group entries keeping current entry state as
	  persistent (weight, conn, ...) big work here...
	* Added support to IP range declaration for virtual_server_group.
	  The IP range has the notation XXX.YYY.ZZZ.WWW-VVV. This will
	  set IPVS virtual_server from WWW to VVV monotonaly incremented by
	  one.
	  look at doc/samples/keepalived.conf.virtual_server_group.
	* Dominik Vogt, <dominik.vogt@gmx.de> enhanced SIGCHLD handler to
	  reap all zombie child processes.
	* Created a generic allocation value block with callback handler for
	  block parsing. This remove duplicated code in parser.
	* VRRP : Jan Holmberg, <jan@artech.net> extended the virtual_routes
	  and static_routes to support source route selection (netlink
	  RTA_PREFSRC).
	  look at doc/samples/keepalived.conf.routes.
	* Some cosmetics patches to reduce code duplication.

003-03-17  Alexandre Cassen  <acassen@linux-vs.org>
	* keepalived-1.0.1 released.
	* This release has been sponsorized by :
	  Creative Internet Techniques, <www.httpd.net>
	  Please visit sponsor homepage, open minded people here !
	* Fixed some Makefile and autoconf code dependence issues.
	* Move keepalived.conf.SYNOPSIS and samples into "doc" directory. 
	* Enhanced HTTP|SSL check to support large url. Get buffer request is
	  now 2KBytes.
	* Removed \n in healthchecker smtp_alert call. This cause some troubles
	  with MTA like qmail. Thanks go to John Koyle, <jkoyle@rfpdepot.com>.
	* Added support to netlink route as global keyword "static_routes".
	  look at doc/samples/keepalived.conf.routes. Routes specified into
	  this block will be added during daemon bootstrap and removed during
	  daemon shutdown. Differential conf parsing is enabled for this block,
	  removing/adding static_route can be done on the fly sending SIGHUP
	  signal to daemon.
	* VRRP : Added support to "virtual_routes". This is the same as
	  virtual_address. Those routes are set when VRRP instance enter
	  MASTER state and removed otherwise. Differential conf parsing is
	  enabled for this block. This concept extend VRRP and bring
	  dynamic routing as a "route takeover" concept.
	* VRRP : Rewrote the VRRP vip handling to use template lib list
	  structure. VIP and E-VIP are no longer a simple array reallocated.
	  List library is used to limite code duplication.
	* VRRP : Extended virtual_ipaddres and virtual_ipaddress_excluded
	  block to support "dev" specification. So that a VIP can be set to
	  a specific interface instead of default runing VRRP instance
	  interface.
	* VRRP : Added support to "track_interface". Interesting for use with
	  vlan interface. The concept here is to drive VRRP FSM according
	  do both "interface" and "track_interface" state. If tracked interface
	  is down or instance interface is down then VRRP instance transit to
	  FAULT state. For use with vlan, add track to interface vlan belong
	  to. Look at doc/sample/keepalived.conf.track_interface for sample.
	  doc/keepalived.conf.SYNOPSIS for configuration details.
	* VRRP : Extended FSM FAULT state to keep in fault if track_interface
	  still fault.
	* VRRP : Extended sync group design to test if group is unary or not.
	* Some code cleaning and cosmetics enhancements.

2003-01-06  Alexandre Cassen  <acassen@linux-vs.org>
	* keepalived-1.0.0 released.
	* After fixed all bugs users reported during 2 months, I am glad to
	  announce the first STABLE production ready Keepalived release.
	* Rename keepalived.init to keepalived RedHat startup script. Fixed
	  some issues to be RedHat release generic. Thanks go to
	  Jeroen Simonetti <jeroens@q-go.com> & Jason Gilbert <jason@doozer.com>
	* Jason Gilbert, <jason@doozer.com> cleaned keepalived.spec.
	* Added support to "ha_suspend" for healthcheckers. This option, if set,
	  inform Keepalived to active/suspend checkers according to netlink
	  IP address information reflection. If one IP is removed and this is
	  a virtual_server VIP then the healthcheckers corresponding will be
	  desactivated. (and reciprocity).
	* Added support to "notify_up" & "notify_down" for realserver config.
	  These options specify a script to be run according to healthchecker
	  activity. If healthchecking fails then "notify_down" script is
	  launched (and reciprocity for healthcheck succeed). This can be
	  usefull for global monitoring system, to send alert to Unicenter TNG
	  or HPOV.
	* Set default realserver weight to 1. So, realserver will be active
	  if no weight is specified into the configuration file.
	* Review the layer4.c/tcp_socket_state to return connection in progress
	  only if SOL_SOCKET/SO_ERROR return EINPROGRESS. Thanks go to
	  Mark Weaver, <mark@npsl.co.uk>
	* Reviewed the global SIGCHLD handler to not suspend execution of the
	  calling process if status is not immediately available for one of the
	  child processes. This remove zombies by reaping.
	* Extended the parser.c/set_value() code to accept encapsulated quoted
	  string.
	* Review SMTP DBG() message to LOG_INFO message for more verbose
	  error handling.
	* Review the check_tcp.c/check_http.c logging messages to be more
	  detailed.
	* Review the check_tcp.c/check_http.c retry facility to fixes some
	  stalled issues.
	* VRRP : Added support to sync_group smtp notification in addition to
	  the per instances approach.
	* VRRP : Fixed some IPSEC-AH seq_num synchronizations issues. Force
	  seq_num sync if vrrp instance is linked to a group.
	* VRRP : In BACKUP state, force a new MASTER election is received adv.
	  has a lower priority as locale instance.
	* VRRP : vrrp.c/vrrp_state_master_rx(), sync IPSEC-AH seq_num counter
	  (decrement) if receiving higher prio advert in MASTER state.
	* VRRP : Reviewed the TSM to be fully filled. Extended speed-up
	  synchronization handling MASTER sync if group is not already synced.
	* VRRP : Leaving fault state, force MASTER transition is received adv
	  priority is lower than locale.
	* VRRP : Extended the parser to not be borred with sync_group
	  declaration position in the conf file. vrrp_sync_group can be
	  declared before or after vrrp_instance. Done by adding a reverse
	  instance lookup during parsing.
	* VRRP : sync_master_election cleanup.
	* Some cosmetics patches.
	* Created the keepalived/samples/keepalived.conf.SYNOPSIS to describe
	  all keywords available.

2002-11-20  Alexandre Cassen  <acassen@linux-vs.org>
	* keepalived-0.7.6 released.
	* Created a common library for code modularization. This lib will
	  be used by all Keepalived components (genhash + Keepalived) to
	  reduce repeated and duplicated code.
	* Rewrote the genhash utility using the common lib. The design is
	  similar to Keepalived core design.
	* Reviewed the autoconf and Makefiles for new code architecture.
	* Created a html utility lib for HTTP headers manipulations.
	* Extended the CHECK_HTTP and CHECK_SSL checkers to support remote
	  webserver HTTP header status_code. HTTP status_code is parsed
	  according to rfc2616.6.1. The keyword created for the new feature is
	  "status_code" inside and "url" declaration. "status_code" feature
	  can be mixed with "digest" feature. See the samples directory
	  keepalived/samples/keepalived.conf.status_code for example.
	* Review the CHECK_HTTP and CHECK_SSL MD5SUM code to use a common
	  stream handling function.
	* Matthijs van der Klip, <Matthijs.van.der.Klip@tech.omroep.nl> and I
	  fixed a bug into the HTTP/SSL code that close the socket fd even
	  if remote webserver has not been connected. As a result of fact,
	  next socket created were imediatly closed. As a side effect, this
	  altered the SMTP notification when remote webserver checked fall. No
	  SMTP notification were sent if webserver were detected DOWN. Thanks
	  to Matthijs for time debugging and investigation.
	* VRRP : Rewrote the previous Gratuitous ARP facility. Created a lib
	  (vrrp_arp.c) dealing with PF_PACKET-SOCK_RAW-ETH_P_RARP and
	  sockaddr_ll.
	* VRRP : Some cosmetics patch for messages logging.
	* VRRP : Fixed an issue during VRRP packet building, appending VRRP
	  VIPs to the VRRP packet in the network order form.
	* VRRP : Reviewed the previous VRRP packet building process to not
	  create the ARP header. Removec the previous hacky
	  PF_PACKET-SOCK_PACKET-0x300 to use AF_INET-SOCK_RAW-PROTO to leave
	  kernel appending ARP header since code doesn t currently support
	  VRRP VMAC.
	* VRRP : Rewrote the previous vrrp_send_pkt() function to deal with
	  sendmsg(). optimization lazzyness :)
	* VRRP : Extended the interfaces library to support common utility
	  functions (if_setsockopt_hdrincl, if_setsockopt_bindtodevice, ...)
	* VRRP : Finally extend the code to support VRRP IPSEC-AH authentication
	  method. Created a IPSEC-AH seq_number syncrhonization mecanism during
	  VRRP MASTER/BACKUP elections.
	* VRRP : Extended the VRRP TSM to speed up instances syncrhonization
	  during FAULT->BACKUP & FAULT->MASTER state transition.
	* Some cosmetics patches. This release is proposed as a 1.0.0 STABLE
	  release candidate.

2002-09-17  Alexandre Cassen  <acassen@linux-vs.org>
	* keepalived-0.7.1 released.
	* Fixed a MISC_CHECK issue when registering next timer checker. Must
	  register a new timer thread before forking process. This imply for
	  the user the extra script call must not execute in more than
	  checker->vs->delay_loop.
	* Extented the ipfwwrapper (for LVS kernel 2.2) to not set ipchains
	  rules if nat_mask is not specified in the configuration file.
	* VRRP : Added support to delayed gratuitous ARP send. When one instance
	  enter to MASTER state a timer thread is registered. The default delay
	  is 5secs. This delay is configurable per vrrp instance and handle the
	  'garp_master_delay' keyword. This delay refer to the delay after
	  MASTER state transition we want to launch gratuitous ARP.
	* VRRP : Force health checker enable flag if VRRP framework is not
	  selected.
	* VRRP : Review the gratuitous ARP helper function to only send
	  gratuitous ARP if VRRP VIPs are set.
	* VRRP : Review the FSM to eliminate stalled flapping loop. The state
	  transition diagram implemented is :
	                           +---------------+
	          +----------------|               |----------------+

	  The state DUMMY_MASTER state has been removed since it is a fake.
	* VRRP : In order to handle all possible state transition, a Transition
	  State Matrix design (TSM) has been added. This matrix defines
	  transition state handlers for VRRP sync group extension. The TSM
	  implemented is (cf: vrrp_scheduler.c for more informations) :
	   \ E |  B  |  M  |  F  |
	   S \ |     |     |     |
	 ------+-----+-----+-----+     Legend:
	   B   |  x     1     2  |       B: VRRP BACKUP state
	 ------+                 |       M: VRRP MASTER state
	   M   |  3     x     4  |       F: VRRP FAULT state
	 ------+                 |       S: VRRP start state (before transition)
	   F   |  5     6     x  |       E: VRRP end state (after transition)
	 ------+-----------------+       [1..6]: Handler functions.
	* VRRP : Set ms_down_timer to 3 * advert_int + TIMER_SKEW when leaving
	  MASTER state.
	* VRRP : In MASTER state, when incoming advert match or FAULT state is
	  requested then force leaving MASTER state transition. (review the
	  previous election approach).
	* VRRP : Optimized the leave FAULT state transition. Directly coded into
	  the FSM for speed up recovery or code readability.
	* VRRP : Extended smtp notifier for BACKUP state. Review the MASTER state
	  notification to only notify when VIPs are set.
	* some cosmetics patches.
	* Adam Fletcher, <adamf@rovia.com> created the 'Keepalived+LVS NAT HOWTO'

2002-08-05  Alexandre Cassen  <acassen@linux-vs.org>
	* keepalived-0.6.10 released.
	* Fixed a faked flag during VRRP VIP set. Updated the IP address set flag to reflect
	  netlink return code.
	* Fixed an autoconf issue during selection of VRRP framework.

2002-07-31  Alexandre Cassen  <acassen@linux-vs.org>
	* keepalived-0.6.9 released.
	* Fixe some code dependence selection during compilation. If autoconf netlink
	  probe fails then unset VRRP code.
	* Cleanup daemon lib. Added some logging info for the daemon processing, removed
	  some repeated code part.
	* Added 2 new daemon arguments :
	    --dont-release-vrrp : Dont remove VRRP VIPs on daemon stop
	    --dont-release-ipvs : Dont remove IPVS topology on daemon stop
	* Review the global scheduling process to clear FD queues on master thread
	  destroy.
	* Fixed a forking issue in the MISC_CHECK.
	* Review IPVS wrapper functions to use allocated IPVS rules instead of static
	  referencing pointer.
	* Fixed the IPVS wrapper to delete IPVS entries according to their 'alive' state.
	* Added IPVS support to alive flag for VS entries.
	* Rewrote the previous main.c to support configuration reload on the fly. Extented
	  signal handling to register a conf reload_thread on SIGHUP. The software design
	  used here is a dynamic differential conf file reloading framework. This design
	  offer key decision to add/remove new/old entries to/from low-level framework:
	  IPVS topology and netlink IP addresses entries. This design reduce to the max
	  the global service interruption since only negative diff entries are removed.
	  For VRRP config reload on the fly, if you plan to add/remove many VIPs consider
	  VIP declaration into the virtual_ipaddress_excluded since they are not present
	  into VRRP adverts.
	* Review the keepalived.init script to support restart and reload arguments.
	* Fixed some typo issues.

2002-07-16  Alexandre Cassen  <acassen@linux-vs.org>
	* keepalived-0.6.8 released.
	* Alex Kramarov, <alex@incredimail.com> & Remi Nivet, <Remi.Nivet@atosorigin.com>
	  reported an assertion error during smtp notification process. The assertion
	  caused a bad file descriptor registration during in_progress connection
	  handling. Fixed registering an event thread calling upper level SMTP
	  protocol in_progress connection handler. So the SMTP stream handlers use
	  global I/O multiplexer on connection success.
	* Benoit Gaussen, <ben@trez42.net> and I added support to "inhibit" feature.
	  Added a new keyword called "inhibit_on_failure" for real_server declaration.
	  If specified the real_server will not be removed from the IPVS topology if
	  real_server fail according to checker result. Instead of removing the entry
	  from IPVS topology, the corresponding real_server weight will be set to 0.
	  When real_server will be back, then weight will be set back to original value.
	  See sample directory for example.
	* Added support to IP_MASQ_CMD_SET_DEST for 2.2 krnl and IP_VS_SO_SET_EDITDEST
	  for 2.4 IPVS code to provide support to "inhibit" feature.
	* Review Makefile.in to exit on compilation error.
	* Extended autconf script to check for kernel netlink support.

2002-07-12  Alexandre Cassen  <acassen@linux-vs.org>
	* keepalived-0.6.7 released.
	* Rewrote the previous SMTP notification framework. New code use a strong
	  multi-threaded FSM design.
	* Moved the SMTP get_local_name() into utils.c
	* IPVS : updated the code to support IPVS_SVC_PERSISTENT_TIMEOUT. Introduced
	  into the new libipvs coming with ipvs-1.0.4.
	* VRRP : Extended the mcast membership subscription to handle more robust
	  mcast subscription errors. Removed the previous ugly stalling sleeping
	  call retry for membership subscription. Membership subscriptions are now
	  multi-threaded to not degrade global scheduling timer.
	* VRRP : Remi Nivet, <Remi.Nivet@atosorigin.com> pointed out a buffer
	  overflow during the sending advert interface binding process.
	* Some more cosmetics patches.

2002-07-05  Alexandre Cassen  <acassen@linux-vs.org>
	* keepalived-0.6.6 released.
	* added indentation style .indent.pro
	* Review the previous source tree. Splitted the code into functional subdirs.
	  Added multi-level automake scripts. The source tree looks like :
		.
		|-- bin
		|-- genhash
		|-- keepalived
		|   |-- core
		|   |-- etc
		|   |   |-- init.d
		|   |   `-- keepalived
		|   |-- healthcheck
		|   |-- include
		|   |-- libipfwc
		|   |-- libipvs
		|   |-- samples
		|   `-- vrrp
		`-- lib
	* Refine autoconf/automake scripts. Added automake support to libipvs and
	  libipfwc. Added code selection compilation for libipvs and libipfwc.
	* Review Makefile(s) to use more convenient facilities like distclean, ...
	* Review the Makefile(s) code dependencies.
	* Added support to modprobe_ipvs if the ip_vs.o module is not loaded.
	  If modprobe fails then IPVS is assumed unavailable.
	* Refine the IPVS wrapper to be more tolerant. When a VS or RS is already
	  configured don t stop the daemon. The daemon is stopped only on critical
	  IPVS errors.
	* VRRP : Review the bootstrap sequence to start daemon even if one of the
	  instance want to run on an interface administratively shut. Added extension
	  to FSM to force transition to FAULT state during bootstrap if the interface
	  is shut.
	* Updated the TODO file.
	* Some cosmetics patches.

2002-07-01  Alexandre Cassen  <acassen@linux-vs.org>
	* keepalived-0.6.5 released.
	* Fixed a NULL pointer exception while releasing IPVS entries.
	* Review the Makefile.in to fixe some conventional issue. Fixed a libipvs
	  dependance code selection.
	* Christophe Varoqui, <Christophe.Varoqui@free.fr> created the rpm spec file.
	* Roberto Nibali, <ratz@linux-vs.org> helped during OLS with code cleanup.
	  Review the whole code coding style to use more conventional indentation. The
	  one used into LVS and Kernel code. Coding style provided by the following
	  command :
	    find . -name "*.[chS]" -exec indent -kr -i8 -ts8 -sob -l80 -ss -bs -psl \
	    {} \; && find . -name "*~" -exec rm  {} \;
	* Roberto Nibali and I review the DEBUG logging facility adding global DBG()
	  func declaration.
	* Roberto Nibali fixed two potential buffer overflow (strcpy).
	* Richard  L. Allbery, <rla@prideindustries.com> pointed out a fwmark issue.
	  Healthcheckers is enabled if virtual service is a fwmark.
	* Some cosmetics patches.

2002-06-25  Alexandre Cassen  <acassen@linux-vs.org>
	* keepalived-0.6.4 released.
	* Rewrote the previous ip address utilities functions. Review the string
	  to ulong convertion function to support CIDR filtering and more simple
	  handling ("without all hexadecimal and shorthand"), pickted from Paul
	  Vixie code.
	* VRRP : extended the notify framework to support scripts inside a
	  vrrp_sync_group. view the sample/keepalived.conf.vrrp.sync file.
	* VRRP : Review the previous vrrp_sync_group block. New declaration
	  is : view the sample/keepalived.conf.vrrp.sync file.
	* VRRP : fixed a FSM sync_group side effect in FAULT state.
	* Fixed a Kernel 2.2 code selection issue (ETHTOOL).
	* Added support to wensong libipvs.
	* Fixed a sorry_server cleanup side effect.
	* Alex Kramarov, <alex@incredimail.com> fine the keepalived.init script
	  to be compatible with redhat chkconfig.

2002-06-18  Alexandre Cassen  <acassen@linux-vs.org>
	* keepalived-0.6.3 released.
	* VRRP : Christian Motelet, <cmotelet@canal-plus.com> pointed out a
	  flapping issue when runing vrrp_sync_group on multiple NICs. This have
	  been fixed adding leave FAULT state transition on both FSM state (read
	  & read_to). The group leave fault state if all NIC of each VRRP Instance
	  are functional.
	* Fixed some issue in the autoconf/automake scripts.

2002-06-16  Alexandre Cassen  <acassen@linux-vs.org>
	* keepalived-0.6.2 released.
	* Andres Salomon, <dilinger@voxel.net> enhanced the autoconf/automake
	  scripts to be more generic and to facilitate cross compilation. Including
	  more efficient IPVS code detection, Kernel version, install script
	  location, ...
	* Johannes Erdfelt, <johannes@erdfelt.com> fixed a genhash get request
	  length calculation issue.
	* Johannes Erdfelt, <johannes@erdfelt.com> fixed a wrong printed IP address
	  issue due to a static pivot buffer called multiple times for a single
	  syslog call.
	* Johannes Erdfelt, <johannes@erdfelt.com> enhanced SMTP notification
	  framework to use more compliant SMTP protocol handling. Enhanced both
	  sending and receiving functions. A nice response code buffer handling
	  calculating remote SMTP server retcode.
	* Johannes Erdfelt, <johannes@erdfelt.com> fixed a NULL pointer exception
	  into the 2.2 ipvswrapper code.
	* Aneesh Kumar, <aneesh.kumar@digital.com> fixed a compilation issue for
	  CI-LINUX checker compilation.
	* Jan Du Caju, <jan@kulnet.kuleuven.ac.be> fixed a compilation dependence
	  selection into the VRRP framework when compiling without LVS support.
	  This disable checkers activity update when compiled without LVS support.
	* fixed a dereferencing pointer into the parser.
	* move the dump configuration to printout conf after daemon initialization.
	* VRRP : Added support to start on complete init. VRRP framework and thus
	  keepalived will start if VRRP instances are properly configured.

2002-06-13  Alexandre Cassen  <acassen@linux-vs.org>
	* keepalived-0.6.1 released.
	* Aneesh Kumar, <aneesh.kumar@digital.com> and I added support to
	  Cluster Infrastructure checkers. Providing HA-LVS for their cluster
	  project (http://ci-linux.sourceforge.net/). The new checker added
	  provide a derivation to the internal CI healthcheck mechanism.
	* Enhanced the Kernel netlink reflector to drive global healthcheckers
	  activity. The policy implemented here is : If healthchecker is performing
	  test on a service that belong to a VIP not owned by the director, then
	  the healthchecker is suspended. This suspend/active state is particulary
	  usefull if runing VRRP for HA => That way the backup LVS will not charge
	  the realserver pool since LVS VIP is owned by master LVS.
	* Cosmetics patches into the vector lib.
	* VRRP : Rewrote the previous VRRP synchronization instance policy.
	  Created a new config block called "vrrp_sync_group" that define VRRP
	  instances synchronization dependences. That way we replace the previous
	  "by-pair" sync approach by this "by-group" approach. This can be useefull
	  for firewall HA with many NICs. Created a dedicated framework to speed up
	  takeover synchronization.
	* VRRP : Added support to CIDR notation for VRRP VIPs definitions
	  => VRRP VIPs definition like a.b.c.d/e. By default "e" value is set to 32.
	* VRRP : Added support to multicast source IP address selection
	  => "mcast_src_ip" keyword. Can be usefull for strongly filtered env.
	  The mcast group subscription is done using the NIC default IP after this
	  mcast_src_ip is used if specified.
	* VRRP : Enhanced the link media failure detection. Added support to the
	  new kernel SIOCETHTOOL probing for ETHTOOL_GLINK command. New drivers
	  use this ETHTOOL interface to report link failure activity. During
	  bootstrap a probe is done to determine the proper polling method to
	  use for link media failure detection. The policy used is : probe for
	  SIOCGMIIREG if not supported then try SIOCETHTOOL GLINK probe, otherwise
	  use a ioctl SIOCGIFFLAGS polling function mirroring kernel NIC flags to
	  localy reflected representation.
	* Ramon Kagan, <rkagan@YorkU.CA> and I updated the UserGuide.pdf.

2002-05-30  Alexandre Cassen  <acassen@linux-vs.org>
	* keepalived-0.5.9 released.
	* Added support to realserver_group. The work is not yet finished since
	  it introduces new compilation design currently not supported. So please
	  do not use yet.
	* VRRP : Review the script notification. Moved to a script per VRRP
	  instance state => Created new keywords notify_backup|master|fault
	  to run a specific script during backup|master|fault state transition.
	* VRRP : Added support to quoted strings for notify_backup|master|fault.
	  Can now launch script passing arguments.
	  See sample directory for examples.
	* VRRP : Added a protocol extension called "virtual_ipaddress_excluded".
	  This configuration block is similar to "virtual_ipaddress" block =>
	  those VIPs (called E-VIPs) are set throught netlink kernel channel and
	  gratuitous arp are sent over each E-VIP. The only difference is that
	  they are not added into VRRP packet adverts. This can be usefull for
	  big env where you want to run many VRRP VIPs (200 for example).
	  VRRP packet lenght are limited to a 20 VIPs, if you want more VRRP VIPs
	  add them to the "virtual_ipaddress_excluded" configuration block.
	* VRRP : Added more logging facility when setting/removings VIPs & E-VIPs.
	* VRRP : Created a new FSM state called become_master in charge of 
	  VIPs/E-VIPs/notifications handling. The goto_master state is now a state
	  where the instance send an advert to force a new MASTER election setting
	  the instance into a transition mode. If election success its finaly
	  transit to become_master state to own VIPs/E-VIPs and launch scripts.
	* VRRP : Force a new MASTER election when receiving a lower prio advert.
	* VRRP : Review the vrrp_scheduler.c to use more conventional FSM design.
	  This reduce and beautifull the code.
	* VRRP : Fixed a very noisy flapping issue observed on heavy loaded env.
	  Simulating big traffic on a backbone figure out this flapping issue.
	  Added support to a TIMER_MICRO_ADJUST to prevent against timer degradation.
	  This can be view as a DOS protection policy. VRRP MASTER timers are adjusted
	  if they are too degradated, due to heavy loaded networking env introducing
	  latency receiving/sending VRRP protocol adverts.
	  Thanks goes to Paul, <xerox@foonet.net> for pointing it out and providing
	  access to its Internet routing backbone.

2002-05-21  Alexandre Cassen  <acassen@linux-vs.org>
	* keepalived-0.5.8 released.
	* Added an OpenSSL Licence exception to grant Keepalived compilation
	  with OpenSSL Toolkit.
	  Thanks to Andres Salomon, <dilinger@voxel.net> for suggesting.
	* Added connection port selection for Healthcheckers (TCP_CHECK,
	  HTTP|SSL_GET). Can be usefull for Healthcheck in fwmark LVS topology
	  for grouping service.
	  Thanks to Richard  L. Allbery, <rla@prideindustries.com> for suggection.
	  See samples directory for examples.
	* Fixed some IPVS exclusion code when running --disable-lvs.
	* Added support to VirtualHost selection when using HTTP|SSL_GET.
	  See samples directory for examples.
	* Added VirtualHost selection into the genhash utility.
	* Fixed some IPVS sync daemon initializations issues.
	* Cometics patches in IPVS wrapper framework.
	* Added support to quoted string. This can be usefull if you are using
	  MISC_CHECK and you want to pass arguments to called script. See samples.
	* Prepare work on real_server_group in order to group some realserver
	  declaration.
	* VRRP : Fixed a password length exception causing an unwanted dropping
	  issue.
	* VRRP : Enhanced the MASTER state to send gratuitous arp if receiving
	  a remote lower prio advert => This fix a remote stalled ARP cache.
	  Thanks to Simon Kirby, <sim@netnation.com> for discussing this case.

2002-05-02  Alexandre Cassen  <acassen@linux-vs.org>
	* keepalived-0.5.7 released.
	* Review autoconf/automake scripts to be more generic on system and code
	  selection. Added primitives (configure) :
	    --disable-lvs-syncd : Do not use IPVS sync daemon
	    --disable-lvs       : Do not use IPVS framework
	    --disable-vrrp      : Do not use VRRP framework
	    --enable-debug      : Compile with debugging flags
	* Fixed a SSL stream handling bug.
	  Thanks to Andres Salomon, <dilinger@voxel.net> for pointing the issue.
	* Added a global memory counter to track global memory used.
	* Fixed configuration parser. read_line. Remove static allocated
	  temporary read buffer. Only handle stream if line has been spitted into
	  vector.
	* Limit maximum number of VIPs per VRRP Instance to 20. (for fragmentation,
	  overhead, and others reasons).
	* Added IPVS wrapper support to persistence granularity.
	  Thanks to Mike Zimmerman, <tarmon@spamcop.net> for the suggestion.
	* Review smtp notifier to handle VRRP MASTER state transition alert.
	  Thanks to Paul, <xerox@foonet.net> for the suggestion.
	* Review the UserGuide.pdf to fixe some english issues :)
	  Thanks to Jacques Thomas, <jacktom@noos.fr> for reviewing.

2002-04-13  Alexandre Cassen  <acassen@linux-vs.org>
	* keepalived-0.5.6 released.
	* VRRP : Review in "GOTO_MASTER_STATE" the IP address handling.
	  send protocol adverts before registering IP address to the interface.
	* VRRP : Review the "LEAVE_MASTER_STATE" to only handle state transition
	  if wanted states are BACKUP or FAULT.
	* VRRP : Review the BACKUP state to force new protocol election if
	  receiving a lower priority advert.
	* VRRP : Fixed a BACKUP to MASTER state transition only if interface is
	  reported UP.
	* VRRP : Fake the "ipvs_syncd_cmd" function if running LVS using a Kernel
	  2.2.

2002-04-10  Alexandre Cassen  <acassen@linux-vs.org>
	* keepalived-0.5.5 released.
	* Fixed a gratuitous ARP porting bug.
	* VRRP : Review the data structure to be more generic
	  and clean with the rest of the code.
	* VRRP : Remove the interface flags (NIC) ioctl functions
	* VRRP : Created an interface (NIC) library giving access
	  to common interface helpers functions.
	* VRRP : Created an interface lookup function creating a global
	  interface structure during daemon bootstrap. Consist of a netlink
	  RTM_GETLINK & RTM_GETADDR lookup, so we can work with a userspace
	  interface representation.
	* VRRP : Create a netlink kernel reflection framework updating
	  dynamically our interface structure according to kernel
	  netlink broadcast. This design is highly inspired from zebra.
	  => Reflection mean : wait for netlink kernel broadcast, if received,
	  wakeup netlink filter to update our userspace representation.
	  Prefer this design instead of a delayed netlink poller. That way
	  we reduce global overhead.
	* VRRP : VRRP need to detect failure from many places.
	  If netlink can notify for many troubles like mainly
	  IFF_UP|DOWN & IFF_RUNNING, those flags are kernel drivers dependent.
	  To reduce takeover time and performance we need to have informations like
	  : Does the media link is present ?. The fact is that most of the new NICs
	  own embended hardware chip providing such informations. So created a
	  MII transceiver status register thread poller. Monitoring Basic Mode
	  Status Register (BMSR) of the MII status words. Waiting for kernel
	  NIC drivers hackers to support this functionnality through netlink
          (=> Like a IFF_RUNNING update broadcast).
	* VRRP : Linked the state machine to the global interface structure.
	  NIC failure/events are handled.
	* VRRP : Review the whole state machine code to be more realistic. The
	  State transition diagram described into the RFC2338 is an obtimist
	  view. The VRRP state transition diagram implemented here is :

                              +---------------+

                              +---------------+

	* VRRP : Robust multicast handling. Something really strange
	  is : after a NIC failure (in fallback mode) without closing
	  the socket, multicast advert can be sent but not received ?
	  really strange don t know why probably an IGMP resubmit ?.
	  So multicast group is left during failover (media trouble,
          IFF_DOWN or !IFF_RUNNING). In fallback, we register a new
	  membership and synchronize all the packet dispatcher fds.
	* VRRP : Fixed a checksum trouble using password authentication.
	* VRRP : Added support to the LVS sync daemon. This permit
	  LVS sync daemon to be state drived by a specific VRRP instance.
	* Review the autoconf/automake to be more generic.
	* Some cosmetics patches.

2002-02-25  Alexandre Cassen  <acassen@linux-vs.org>
	* keepalived-0.5.3 released.
	* Added autoconf / automake generic scripts.
	* Rewrite the configuration file stream parser.
	  Using a generic keywords tree. Each keyword refer a specific
	  stream handler. The main stream processor is a multilevel
	  recursive function getting file stream and backtracking the
	  keyword tree. Kind of global compiler structure using event driven
	  stream processing.
	* Re-design the global data structure to be much more generic and
	  to dissociate LVS configuration related to checkers related. Remove
	  static char lenght to use dynamic length strings.
	* Created a global timer framework.
	* Created a global vector template, used in cofiguration file
	  parsing (both stream process & keywords tree generation).
	* Created a global list template, used in most of the code.
	* Review the global scheduler to remove repeated code.
	* Created a global checkers API. The design and goal here is to
	  facilitate new checkers creation by localizing specific checker
	  code into a single file without any other global framework
	  integration.
	* Patched a SSL stream handling race condition finding end of stream.
	* Jan Holmberg, review MISC checker to use forked process to not degrade
	  global scheduler timer.
	* Revisited the whole code to use new templates structures.
	* Fixed a url lentgh bug into the genhash utility.
	* Fabrice Bucher, <fabrice.bucher@urbanet.ch> fixed a timeout_persistence
	  bug in the IPVS wrapper code.
	* Bradley McLean, <bradlist@bradm.net> added support to '0' port number
	  service in VS manipulation. Useful for balancing all services (host rather
	  than service).
	* Matthijs van der Klip, <matthijs.van.der.klip@nos.nl> enhanced smtp
	  framework to use SMTP header and email enclosed with angle brackets.

2001-12-20  Alexandre Cassen  <acassen@linux-vs.org>
	* keepalived-0.4.9a released.
	* Jan and I patched a memory pointer problems in vrrp_scheduler.c
	  Thanks to Negrea Mihai, <mike@umft.ro> for reporting.
	* Jan Holmberg, patched a memory reallocation pointer
	  exception in memory management framework.
	* Jan Holmberg, patched a vrrp vip set/remove retry.
	* Some cosmetics/logging patches.
	* Created Keepalived UserGuide.

2001-12-10  Alexandre Cassen  <acassen@linux-vs.org>
	* keepalived-0.4.9 released.
	* Jan Holmberg, <jan@artech.net> added a memory managment framework.
	  In debug mode it is used as a memory leak buster. We can so use it
	  to debug quickly memory leaks (buffer overrun, allocation errors, ...).
	* Jan Holmberg and I added support to SSL. Checker SSL_GET. Can be used
	  with autogenerated cert or with specific cafile, certfile, keyfile.
	* Use the OpenSSL, <www.openssl.org> library for MD5 & SSL functions.
	* Jan Holmberg and I Rewrote the HTTP_GET code to use full asynchronous
	  stream handling. The code use a common part for HTTP/SSL stream handling.
	  Review the MD5 digest buffer computation, update MD5 over received buffer.
	* Patched some memory leaks in smtp handling.
	* Jan Holmbarg added support to LVS FWMARK.
	* Added command line option for keepalived. Used the libpopt library.
	  -h, -v, -n, -d, -l, -f.
	* Jan Holmberg and I added debugging facility on keepalived console.
	* Added a BOOTSTRAP_DELAY of 1sec when registering checkers during
	  daemon bootstrap.
	* VRRP : Jan Holmberg added possibility to run an extra script when
	  VRRP Instance become or leave MASTER STATE (=> using a forked process).
	* Review/fine the whole code to apply cosmetics patch.
	* Rewrote the genhash utility.
	* Started checkers API specs.
	* doc doc doc...

2001-11-20  Alexandre Cassen  <acassen@linux-vs.org>
	* keepalived-0.4.8 released.
	* Rewrite the whole VRRP previous code.
	* VRRP : Created a hierarchic scheduling framework.
	  Handle VRRP instances multiplexing on the same I/O fd.
	  VRRP I/O events are handled by our global scheduling 
	  framework. Then the global sheduling framework call a VRRP
	  I/O instance dispatcher to manage VRRP instances.
	* VRRP : Created a temporary socket pool to handle register
	         our VRRP thread instances.
	  We create & allocate a socket pool here. The soft design
	  can be sum up by the following sketch :
 
	         fd1  fd2    fd3  fd4          fdi  fdi+1
	      -----\__/--------\__/---........---\__/---
	         | ETH0 |    | ETH1 |          | ETHn |
	         +------+    +------+          +------+
 
 	  Here we have n physical NIC. Each NIC own a maximum of 2 fds.
	  (one for VRRP the other for IPSEC_AH). All our VRRP instances
	  are multiplexed through this fds. So our design can handle 2*n
	  multiplexing points.
	* VRRP : Review the multicast socket creating. We bind the socket
	  to a specific NIC. inbound & outbound traffic are bound to the
	  NIC.
	  => why IP_ADD_MEMBERSHIP & IP_MULTICAST_IF doesnt set
	     sk->bound_dev_if themself ??? !!!
	     Needed for filter multicasted advert per interface.
	  => For inbound binding we use SO_BINDTODEVICE kernel option.
	* VRRP : Created a read dispatcher thread to deal with our sockpool.
	  Handle VRRP states & transition states.
	* VRRP : Created a VRRP synchronization instance circuit. This
	  functionnality gave you the ability to monitor VRRP instance
	  each other. This mean that if 2 VRRP instances are monitoring 
	  themself and if one of this instance change state, the other
	  follow the same state. ex.: With 2 VRRP instances (VI_1 & VI_2)
	  if VI_1 become backup then VI_2 become backup too. (symetricly
	  with master VRRP state).
	* VRRP : Rewrite the netlink interface to use non blocking socket.
	* VRRP : Rewrite the ipaddress handling to use the new netlink
	  interface.
	* VRRP : Remove the VRPP VMAC handling since linux kernel only
	  permit to use one MAC address on a specific NIC. We use gratuitous
	  arp when setting up VRRP VIP, to uptade remote host arp caches.
	  => In certain case this can cause a TCP session renegociation
	     which can cause a permature session end.
	  => To be fully compliant with the VRRP RFC, need to patch the
	     kernel to gave it the possibility to deal with more than one
	     MAC address at a time. Give me clue on it please ! to same me
	     a little time :)
	* Starting VRRP documentation.
	* Patch a pidfile handling bug when forking the keepalived daemon.
	  Thanks goes to Gianni D'Aprile for pointing it to me.
	* Patch a timer race condition into the scheduling framework.
	  This bug caused tcpcheck to respawn quickly...
	  Thanks goes to Gianni D'Aprile for pointing it to me.

2001-11-04  Alexandre Cassen  <acassen@linux-vs.org>
        * keepalived-0.3.8 released.
        * Added support to native IPTABLE LVS CODE
          => using NAT on 2.4 kernel ipchains kernel support
             has been removed.
        * Added support to Direct Routing & Tunneling.
        * Review the keepalived.init script to be much more generic.

2001-09-14  Alexandre Cassen  <acassen@linux-vs.org>
	* keepalived-0.4.1 released.
	* Added support to LVS kernel 2.4 code

2001-08-23  Alexandre Cassen  <acassen@linux-vs.org>
	* keepalived-0.4.0 released.
	* Patch a race condition into the scheduler timer computation.
	* Patch a race condition into the tcp checker thread. Only
	  register next timer thread if tcp connection is not in progress.
	* Patch a race condition into the http checker thread. Handle
	  empty buffer returned from remote http server.
	* Patch a race condition into the dumping configuration process.
	  A simple dereferencing pointer value...oops...
	* Eric Jarman, <ehj38230@cmsu2.cmsu.edu> added MISC CHECKER.
	  It Perform a system call to run an extra system or script.
	  => security auditing needed for system call,
	  buffer overflow over script path must be handled.

	* Added VRRP support using our scheduling I/O multiplexer.
	  VRRP implementation support to IPSEC-AH using HMAC-96bits digest
	  with anti-replay. rfc2402 & rfc2104.
	* Added routing table fetcher. We ignore route when it is a
	  cloned route from other router, learn by an ICMP redirect
	  or set by kernel. Only UNICAST route are stored.
	* Added dropping packet support.

2001-07-15  Alexandre Cassen  <acassen@linux-vs.org>
	* keepalived-0.3.5 released.
        * Rewrite the whole signal handling, registering a terminating
          thread on signal.
        * Move logsystem to syslog using facility LOG_INFO & LOG_DEBUG.
        * Added a daemonization function imported from zebra.
        * Rewrite the pidfile handling, check if daemon is running, if not
          remove eventual stalled pidfile and create new pidfile.
        * Added a strong scheduling framework based on an I/O multiplexer
          to handle asynchronous process. This code is imported from zebra
          and have been enhanced for keepalived purposes.

          Thread types are :
          . timeouted read on fd.
          . timeouted write on fd.
          . timer.
          . event.
          . terminate event.

          => The zebra framework have been enhanced to add support for timeouted
             read/write fds.

          => With this framework keepalived use a Boss/Worker thread model design,
             fetching ready thread from a master threading queues.

        * Rewrite the configuration file reader to add flexibility on extending.
          The dynamic data structure has been rewritten to use apropriate types.
          Right now parsing framework is ready for easy new checker structures
          integration.
        * Rewrite the smtp connector. The implementation take advantage of the
          I/O multiplexer. All read/write operations from/to the remote smtp server
          are done asynchronously. The implementation is rfc 821 compliant (multiple
          receiver are handled by a multiple RCPT TO command as specified in rfc821.3.1).
        * Rewrite the IPFW & IPVS wrappers.
        * Added support for NAT mask on IP MASQ rules (keyword nat_mask in configuration
          file). Added support for sorry server facility, so when all the server from a 
          VS server pool are removed, a sorry server is automaticaly added to the VS pool 
          (typically this is used when you have a spare server online).
        * Rewrite the previous checkers. Checkers are now based on a hierarchic layer
          stack framework. The protocol implemented for the moment is TCP. All layer 5
          checkers are using layer4.c primitives with the same design :

          . a checker connector thread (creating the socket) registering the connection
            checker thread.
          . a connection checker thread testing connection states (error, in_progress,
            timeout, success). When connection success upper level thread are registered
            to handle checks.
        * Delay loop is now checkers specifics since we can use a multithreaded framework.
        * Update the PDF documentation file.
