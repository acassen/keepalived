There is 2 valid comment valid string : # or ! If you want to add comment
in you configuration file use this char.

1. Globals configurations

This block is divided in 2 sub-block :

	* Global definitions
	* Static routes

	1.1. Global definitions

	The configuration block looks like :

global_defs {				# Block identification
    notification_email {		# Email address to send alerts to
       <EMAIL ADDRESS>			# Standard email address
       <EMAIL ADDRESS>
       ...
    }
    notification_email_from <EMAIL ADDRESS> # Email From dealing with SMTP proto
    smtp_server <ADDRESS>		   # SMTP server IP address or damain name
    smtp_connect_timeout <INTEGER>	   # Number of seconds timeout connect
 					   #  remote SMTP server
    router_id <STRING>			   # String identifying router
    vrrp_mcast_group4 <IPv4 ADDRESS>	   # optional, default 224.0.0.18
    vrrp_mcast_group6 <IPv6 ADDRESS>	   # optional, default ff02::12
}

linkbeat_use_polling	# Use media link failure detection polling fashion

	1.2. Static addresses

	The configuration block looks like :

static_ipaddress {			# block identification
    <IP ADDRESS>/<MASK> brd <IP ADDRESS> dev <STRING> scope <SCOPE>
    <IP ADDRESS>/<MASK> brd <IP ADDRESS> dev <STRING> scope <SCOPE>
    ...
}

SCOPE can take the following values :
	* site
	* link
	* host
	* nowhere
	* global

	1.3. Static routes

	The configuration block looks like :

static_routes {							# block identification
    src <IP ADDRESS> [to] <IP ADDRESS>/<MASK> via|gw <IP ADDRESS> dev <STRING> scope <SCOPE> table <TABLE-ID> # to is optional
    src <IP ADDRESS> [to] <IP ADDRESS>/<MASK> via|gw <IP ADDRESS> dev <STRING> scope <SCOPE> table <TABLE-ID> # to is optional
    src <IP ADDRESS> [to] <IP ADDRESS>/<MASK> via|gw <IP ADDRESS> or <IP ADDRESS> dev <STRING> scope <SCOPE> table <TABLE-ID> # will use multipath route
    blackhole <IP ADDRESS>[/<MASK>]
    ...
}

SCOPE can take the following values :
	* site
	* link
	* host
	* nowhere
	* global

2. VRRP configuration

This block is divided in 3 sub-block :

	* VRRP scripts
	* VRRP synchronization group
	* VRRP instance

	2.1. VRRP scripts

	The configuration block looks like :

vrrp_script <STRING> {          # VRRP script declaration
    script <QUOTED_STRING>      # script to run periodically
    interval <INTEGER>          # run the script this every seconds
    timeout <INTEGER>           # script considered failed after 'timeout' seconds
    weight <INTEGER:-254..254>  # adjust priority by this weight
    fall <INTEGER>              # required number of failures for KO switch
    rise <INTEGER>              # required number of successes for OK switch
}

The script will be executed periodically, every <interval> seconds. Its exit
code will be recorded for all VRRP instances which will want to monitor it.
Note that the script will only be executed if at least one VRRP instance
monitors it with a non-zero weight. Thus, any number of scripts may be
declared without taking the system down.

If unspecified, the weight equals 2, which means that a success will add +2
to the priority of all VRRP instances which monitor it. On the opposite, a
negative weight will be subtracted from the initial priority in case of
failure.

	2.2. VRRP synchronization group

	The configuration block looks like :

vrrp_sync_group <STRING> {	# VRRP sync group declaration
    group {			# group of instance to sync together
      <STRING>			#   a
      <STRING>			#       set
      ...			#             of VRRP_Instance string
    }
    notify_master <STRING>|<QUOTED-STRING> # Script to run during MASTER transit
    notify_backup <STRING>|<QUOTED-STRING> # Script to run during BACKUP transit
    notify_fault <STRING>|<QUOTED-STRING>  # Script to run during FAULT transit
    notify <STRING>|<QUOTED-STRING>	   # Script to run during ANY state transit (1)
    smtp_alert		 # Send email notification during state transit
}

(1) The "notify" script is called AFTER the corresponding notify_* script has
    been called, and is given exactly 4 arguments (the whole string is interpreted
    as a litteral filename so don't add parameters!):

    $1 = A string indicating whether it's a "GROUP" or an "INSTANCE"
    $2 = The name of said group or instance
    $3 = The state it's transitioning to ("MASTER", "BACKUP" or "FAULT")
    $4 = The priority value

    $1 and $3 are ALWAYS sent in uppercase, and the possible strings sent are the
    same ones listed above ("GROUP"/"INSTANCE", "MASTER"/"BACKUP"/"FAULT").

Important: for a SYNC group to run reliably, it is vital that all instances in
           the group are MASTER or that they are all either BACKUP or FAULT. A
           situation with half instances having higher priority on machine A
           half others with higher priority on machine B will lead to constant
           re-elections. For this reason, when instances are grouped, their
           tracking weights are automatically set to zero, in order to avoid
           inconsistent priorities across instances.

	2.3. VRRP instance

	The configuration block looks like :

vrrp_instance <STRING> {		# VRRP instance declaration
    use_vmac				# Use VRRP Virtual MAC
    vmac_xmit_base			# Send/Recv VRRP messages from base
					#  interface instead of VMAC interface
    native_ipv6				# Force instance to use IPv6
					#  when using mixed IPv4&IPv6 conf
    state MASTER|BACKUP			# Start-up default state
    interface <STRING>			# Binding interface
    track_interface {			# Interfaces state we monitor
      <STRING>
      <STRING>
      <STRING> weight <INTEGER:-254..254>
      ...
    }
    track_script {                     # Scripts state we monitor
      <STRING>
      <STRING> weight <INTEGER:-254..254>
      ...
    }
    dont_track_primary                  # (default unset) ignore VRRP interface faults.
                                        #  useful for cross-connect VRRP config.
    mcast_src_ip <IP ADDRESS>		# src_ip to use into the VRRP packets
    unicast_src_ip <IP ADDRESS>		# src_ip to use into the VRRP packets (alias to mcast_src_ip)
    unicast_peer {			# Do not use multicast, instead send VRRP
      <IP ADDRESS>			#  adverts to following list of ip address

    }
    lvs_sync_daemon_interface <STRING>	# Binding interface for lvs syncd
    garp_master_delay <INTEGER>		# delay for gratuitous ARP after MASTER
					#  state transition
    garp_master_repeat <INTEGER>        # how often the gratuitous ARP after MASTER
                                        #  state transition should be repeated?
    garp_master_refresh <INTEGER>	# Periodic delay in seconds sending
					#  gratuitous ARP while in MASTER state
    garp_master_refresh_repeat <INTEGER># how often the periodically repeated gratuitous ARP
                                        #  should be repeated?

    }
    virtual_ipaddress {			# VRRP IP addres block
        <IP ADDRESS>/<MASK> brd <IP ADDRESS> dev <STRING> scope <SCOPE> label <LABEL>
        <IP ADDRESS>/<MASK> brd <IP ADDRESS> dev <STRING> scope <SCOPE> label <LABEL>
        ...
    }
    virtual_ipaddress_excluded {       	# VRRP IP excluded from VRRP

    }
    virtual_routes {			# VRRP virtual routes
    	src <IP ADDRESS> [to] <IP ADDRESS>/<MASK> via|gw <IP ADDRESS> dev <STRING> scope <SCOPE> table <TABLE-ID> metric <METRIC> # to is optional
    	src <IP ADDRESS> [to] <IP ADDRESS>/<MASK> via|gw <IP ADDRESS> dev <STRING> scope <SCOPE> table <TABLE-ID> metric <METRIC> # to is optional
    	src <IP ADDRESS> [to] <IP ADDRESS>/<MASK> via|gw <IP ADDRESS> or <IP ADDRESS> dev <STRING> scope <SCOPE> table <TABLE-ID> # will use multipath route
        ...
	blackhole <IP ADDRESS>[/<MASK>]
    }
    nopreempt					# Override VRRP RFC preemption default
    preempt_delay				# Seconds after startup until
						#  preemption. 0 (default) to 1,000
    debug					# Debug level
    notify_master <STRING>|<QUOTED-STRING>	# Same as vrrp_sync_group

    notify_stop <STRING>|<QUOTED-STRING>	# Script to launch when stopping vrrp
    notify <STRING>|<QUOTED-STRING>		# Same as vrrp_sync_group
    smtp_alert					# Same as vrrp_sync_group
}

SCOPE can take the following values :
	* site
	* link
	* host
	* nowhere
	* global

LABEL is optional and creates a name for the alias. For compatibility with
"ifconfig", it should be of the form <realdev>:<anytext>, for example
eth0:1 for an alias on eth0.

METRIC is optional and specify a route priority.

When a weight is specified in track_interface, instead of setting the vrrp
instance to the FAULT state in case of failure, its priority will be
increased by the weight when the interface is up (for positive weights),
or decreased by the weight's absolute value when the interface is down
(for negative weights). The weight must be comprised between -254 and +254
inclusive. 0 is the default behaviour which means that a failure implies a
FAULT state. The common practise is to use positive weights to count a
limited number of good services so that the server with the highest count
becomes master. Negative weights are better to count unexpected failures
among a high number of interfaces, as it will not saturate even with high
number of interfaces.

The same principle can be applied to track_script entries, except that an
unspecified weight means that the default weight declared in the script
will be used.


3. LVS configuration

This block is divided in 2 sub-block :

	* Virtual server group
	* Virtual server

	3.1. Virtual server group

	The configuration block looks like :

	fwmark <INTEGER>
	...
}

Note:	<IP ADDRESS RANGE> has the form of : XXX.YYY.ZZZ.WWW-VVV, define
	the IP address range starting at WWW and monotonaly incremented by
	one to VVV. Example : 192.168.200.1-10 means .1 to .10 IP addresses.
