.SH NAME
keepalived.conf - configuration file for Keepalived
.br
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B keepalived.conf
is the configuration file which describes all the Keepalived keywords.
Keywords are placed in hierarchies of blocks and subblocks,
each layer being delimited by '{' and '}' pairs.
.PP
Comments start with '#' or '!' to the end of the line and can start
anywhere in a line.
.PP
The keyword 'include' allows inclusion of other configuration files from within
the main configuration file.
.SH PARAMETER SYNTAX
.B <BOOL>
is one of on|off|true|false|yes|no
.PP
.SH Conditional configuration and configuration id
Any configuration line starts with '@' is a conditional configuration line.
The word immediately following (i.e. without any space) the '@' character
is compared against the string specified with the -i command line option,
and if they don't match, the configuration line is ignored.
.PP
The purpose of this is to allow a single configuration file to be used for
multiple systems, where the only differences are likely to be the router_id,
vrrp instance priorities, and possibly interface names.
.PP
For example:
.PP
 global_defs
 {
 @main   router_id main_router
 @backup router_id backup_router
 }
.PP
If keepalived is invoked with -i main, then the router_id will be set to main_router,
if invoked with -i backup, then backup_router, if not invoked with -i, or with
-i anything else, then the router_id will not be set.

.SH Static routes/addresses/rules
.PP
Keepalived can configure static addresses, routes, and rules. These addresses are
.B NOT
moved by vrrpd, they stay on the machine.
If you already have IPs and routes on your machines and
your machines can ping each other, you don't need this section.
The syntax for rules and routes is that same as for ip rule add/ip route add.
.PP
The syntax is the same for virtual addresses and virtual routes. If no dev element
is specified, it defaults to default_interface (default eth0).

.SH VRRP gratuitous ARP and unsolicited neighbour advert delay group(s)
.PP
specifies the setting of delays between sending gratuitous ARPs

upstream switch is unable to handle being flooded with ARPs/NAs.

Use interface when the limits apply on the single physical interface.
Use interfaces when a group of interfaces are linked to the same switch
and the limits apply to the switch as a whole.

.BNote.B: Only one of interface or interfaces should be used per block.

If the global vrrp_garp_interval and/or vrrp_gna_interval are set, any 
interfaces that aren't specified in a garp_group will inherit the global
settings.
