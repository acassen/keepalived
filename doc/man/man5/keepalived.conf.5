.SH NAME
/etc/keepalived/keepalived.conf - configuration file for keepalived
.br
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B keepalived.conf
is the configuration file which describes all the keepalived keywords.
keywords are placed in hierarchies of blocks (and subblocks),
each layer being delimited by '{' and '}' pairs.
.PP
Comments start with '#' or '!' to the end of the line and can start
anywhere in a line.
.PP
Keyword 'include' allows inclusion of other configuration files from within
the main configuration file.
