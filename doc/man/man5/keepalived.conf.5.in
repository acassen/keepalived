.SH NAME
keepalived.conf - configuration file for Keepalived
.br
.PP
.SH Note:
This documentation MUST be considered as THE exhaustive source of information in
order to configure Keepalived. This documenation is supported and maintained by
Keepalived Core-Team.
.PP
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBkeepalived.conf\fR is the configuration file which describes all the
Keepalived keywords. Keywords are placed in hierarchies of blocks and
subblocks, each layer being delimited by '{' and '}' pairs.
.PP
Comments start with '#' or '!' to the end of the line and can start
anywhere in a line.
.PP
The keyword 'include' and variants allow inclusion of other configuration files
from within the main configuration file, or from subsequently included files.
.PP
The format of the include directive is:

\fBinclude\fR FILENAME
.PP
FILENAME can be a fully qualified or relative pathname, and can include wildcards,
including csh style brace expressions such as "{foo/{,cat,dog},bar}" if glob()
supports them.
.PP
After opening an included file, the current directory is set to the directory of
the file itself, so any relative paths included from a file are relative to the
directory of the including file itself.

The include variants add additional include checks to the current include_check level (see below)
The variants are:
.br
\fBincluder\fR FILENAME - same as include_check readable
.br
\fBincludem\fR FILENAME - same as include_check match
.br
\fBincludew\fR FILENAME - same as include_check wildcard_match
.br
\fBincludeb\fR FILENAME - same as include_check brace_match
.br
\fBincludea\fR FILENAME - all include_check checks
.PP
NOTE: If the libc glob() function does not support GLOB_ALTDIRFUNC (e.g. Musl libc as on Alpine Linux etc.),
then only includea, includer and includew of the above options will work.
.PP
Why do we want to allow errors? Suppose a configuration has optional files in /etc/keepalived/conf.d,
then \fIinclude_/etc/keepalived/conf.d/*\fR could be specified, but it should not
error if there are no files in the directory; in this case \fIincluder\fR should be used. Otherwise it
is sensible to use \fIincludea\fR.

include handling will not work with if the include line uses conditional configuration or
parameter substitution, since the detection of the include keywords is done before the
processing on conditional configuration and parameter substitution.

The basic \fIinclude\fR keyword is retained for backward compatibility, since it does not
produce config errors if files could not be opened etc.
.PP
.SH PARAMETER SYNTAX
\fB<BOOL>\fR
is one of on|off|true|false|yes|no
.br
\fB<TIMER>\fR
is a time value in seconds, including fractional seconds, e.g. 2.71828 or 3;
resolution of timer is micro-seconds.
.SH SCRIPTS
There are three classes of scripts can be configured to be executed.

(a) Notify scripts that are run when a vrrp instance or vrrp group
changes state, or a virtual server quorum changes between up and down.

(b) vrrp tracking scripts that will cause vrrp instances to go down it they exit
a non-zero exist status, or if a weight is specified will add or subtract the
weight to/from the priority of that vrrp instance.

(c) LVS checker misc scripts that will cause a real server to be configured down
if they exit with a non-zero status.

By default the scripts will be executed by user keepalived_script if that user
exists, or if not by root, but for each script the user/group under which it is
to be executed can be specified.

There are significant security implications if scripts are executed with root
privileges, especially if the scripts themselves are modifiable or replaceable
by a non root user. Consequently, security checks are made at startup to ensure
that if a script is executed by root, then it cannot be modified or replaced by
a non root user.

All scripts should be written so that they will terminate on receipt of a SIGTERM
signal. Scripts will be sent SIGTERM if their parent terminates, or it is a script
that keepalived is awaiting its exit status and it has run for too long.
.PP
.SH Quoted strings
Quoted strings are specified between " or ' characters and strings are delimited by
whitespace. In the examples below the \' characters are not part of the strings and should not be specified:

.nf
.RS
\'abcd" efg h jkl "mnop\'
.RE

.fi
will be the single string:

.nf
.RS
\'abcd efg h jkl mnop\'
.RE

whereas:

.nf
.RS
\'abcd "efg h jkl" mnop\'
.RE
.fi

will be the three strings:

.nf
.RS
\'abcd\', \'efg h jkl\' and \'mnop\'
.RE

i.e. the " and ' characters are removed and any intervening whitespace is retained.
.PP
Quoted strings can also have escaped characters, like the shell. \\a, \\b, \\E, \\f,
\\n, \\r, \\t, \\v, \\nnn and \\xXX (where nnn is up to 3 octal digits, and XX is any
sequence of hex digits) and \\cC (which produces the control version of
character C) are all supported. \\C for any other character C is just
treated as an escaped version of character C, so \\\\ is a \\ character and
\\" will be a " character, but it won't start or terminate a quoted string.
.PP
For specifying scripts with parameters, unquoted spaces will separate the parameters.
If it is required for a parameter to contain a space, it should be enclosed in single
quotes (').

.PP
.SH CONFIGURATION PARSER
Traditionally the configuration file parser has not been one of the strengths of
keepalived. Lot of efforts have been put to correct this even if this is not the
primal goal of the project.
.SH TOP HIERACHY
.PP
Keepalived configuration file is articulated around a set of configuration blocks.
Each block is focusing and targetting a specific daemon family feature. These features
are:
.PP
\fBGLOBAL CONFIGURATION\fR
.PP
\fBBFD CONFIGURATION\fR
.PP
\fBVRRPD CONFIGURATION\fR
.PP
\fBLVS CONFIGURATION\fR
.SH GLOBAL CONFIGURATION

# syslog entries will have _NAME appended to the ident.
# Note: the namespace cannot be changed on a configuration reload.
\fBnet_namespace \fRNAME

# allows ipsets to be used with a namespace on kernels prior to 3.13.
\fBnamespace_with_ipsets\fR

# If multiple instances of keepalived are run in the same namespace,

Note: All processes/scripts run by keepalived are run with parent death signal set

.SH Linkbeat interfaces
.PP
The linkbeat_interfaces block allows specifying which interfaces should use polling
via MII, Ethtool or ioctl status rather than rely on netlink status updates. This
allows more granular control of global definition \fBlinkbeat_use_polling\fR.
.PP
This option is preferred over the deprecated use of \fBlinkbeat_use_polling\fR in
a vrrp_instance block, since the latter only allows using linkbeat on the interface
of the vrrp_instance itself, whereas \fRtrack_interface\fR and virtual_ipaddresses
and virtual_iproutes may require monitoring other interfaces, which may need to use
linkbeat polling.
.PP
The default polling type to use is MII, unless that isn't supported in which case
ETHTOOL is used, and if that isn't supported then ioctl polling. The preferred type
of polling to use can be specified with MII or ETHTOOL or IOCTL after the interface
name, but if that type isn't supported, a supported type will be used.
.PP
The syntax for linkbeat_interfaces is:
.nf
    \fBlinkbeat_interfaces\fR {
        eth2
        enp2s0 ETHTOOL
    }
.fi
.SH Static track groups
.PP
Static track groups are used to allow vrrp instances to track static addresses,
routes and rules. If a static address/route/rule specifies a track group, then
if the address/route/rule is deleted and cannot be restored, the vrrp instance
will transition to fault state.
.PP
The syntax for a track group is:
.nf
    \fBtrack_group \fRGROUP1 {
        \fBgroup \fR{
            VI_1
            VI_2

    }
.fi
.SH Static routes/addresses/rules
.PP
Keepalived can configure static addresses, routes, and rules. These addresses are
\fBNOT\fR
moved by vrrpd, they stay on the machine.
If you already have IPs and routes on your machines and
your machines can ping each other, you don't need this section.
The syntax for rules and routes is that same as for ip rule add/ip route add
(except shortened option names are not supported due to ambiguities).
The track_group specification refers to a named track_group which lists
the vrrp instances which will track the address, i.e. if the address is
deleted the vrrp instances will transition to backup.

NOTE: since rules without preferences can be added in different orders
due to vrrp instances transitioning from master to backup etc, rules need
to have a preference. If a preference is not specified, keepalived will
assign one, but it will probably not be what you want.
.PP
The syntax is the same for virtual addresses and virtual routes. If no dev element
is specified, it defaults to default_interface (default eth0).
Note: the broadcast address may be specified as '-' or '+' to clear or set the host
bits of the address.
.PP
If a route or rule could apply to either IPv4 or IPv6 it will default to IPv4.
To force a route/rule to be IPv6, add the keyword "inet6".

.SH Track files
.PP
Adds a file to be monitored. The file will be read whenever it is
modified. The value in the file will be recorded for all VRRP instances,
sync groups and real servers which monitor it.
Note that the file will only be read if at least one VRRP instance,
sync group or real server monitors it.

A value will be read as a number in text from the file.  If the weight
configured against the track_file is 0, a non-zero value in the file will
be treated as a failure status, and a zero value will be treated as
an OK status, otherwise the value will be  multiplied by the weight configured
in the track_file statement.

For VRRP instances, if the result is less than -253 anything monitoring the
script will transition to the fault state (the weight can be 254 to allow
for a negative value being read from the file).

If the vrrp instance or sync group is not the address owner and the result is between
-253 and 253, the result will be added to the initial priority of the VRRP instance
(a negative value will reduce the priority), although the effective priority will
be limited to the range [1,254]. Likewise for real servers.

If a vrrp instance using a track_file is a member of a sync group, unless
sync_group_tracking_weight is set on the group weight 0 must be set.
Likewise, if the vrrp instance is the address owner, weight 0 must also be set.

For real servers monitoring the file, the limits of values read from the track
file are 2147483648 to -2147483648. The value, once multiplied by the weight, will
be added to the real server's IPVS weight. If the result is <= than 2147483648
then the checker will be in the FAULT state.

NOTE: weights for track_file for real servers are not fully implemented yet. In
particular allowing weight 0, handling negative calculated values and reloading.

.PP
To avoid having to frequently run a track_script to monitor the existance
of processes (often haproxy or nginx), vrrp_track_process can monitor whether
other processes are running.
.PP
One difference from pgrep is track_process doesn't do a regular expression match of the
command string, but does an exact match. 'pgrep ssh' will match an sshd process, this
track_process will not (it is equivalent to pgrep "^ssh$").
.PP
If full_command is used (equivalent to pgrep -f), /proc/PID/cmdline is used, but
any updates to cmdline will not be detected (a process shouldn't normally change it,
although it is possible with great care, for example systemd).
.PP
Prior to Linux v3.2 track_process will not support detection of changes to a process
name, since the kernel did not notify changes of process name prior to 3.2. Most
processes do not change their process name, but, for example, firefox forks processes
that change their process name to "Web Content". The process name referred to here is
the contents of /proc/PID/comm.
.PP
Quorum is the number of matching processes that must be run for an OK status.
.PP
Delay might be useful if it anticipated that a process may be reloaded (stopped and
restarted), and it isn't desired to down and up a vrrp instance.
.PP
A positive weight means that an OK status will add <weight> to the priority of all
VRRP instances which monitor it. On the opposite, a negative weight will be subtracted
from the initial priority in case of insufficient processes.
.PP
If the vrrp instance or sync group is not the address owner and the result is between
-253 and 253, the result will be added to the initial priority of the VRRP instance
(a negative value will reduce the priority), although the effective priority will
be limited to the range [1,254].
.PP
If a vrrp instance using a track_process is a member of a sync group, unless
sync_group_tracking_weight is set on the group weight 0 must be set.
Likewise, if the vrrp instance is the address owner, weight 0 must also be set.
.PP
Rational for not using pgrep/pidof/killall and the likes:
.PP
Every time pgrep or its equivalent is run, it iterates though the /proc/[1-9][0-9]*
directories, and opens the status and cmdline pseudo files in each directory.
The cmdline pseudo file is mapped to the process's address space, and so if that
part of the process is swapped out, it will have to be fetched from the swap space.
pgrep etc also include zombie processes whereas keepalived does not, since they aren't
running.
.PP
This implementation only iterates though /proc/[1-9][0-9]*/ directories at start up, and
it won't even read the cmdline pseudo files if 'full_command' is not specified for any of
the vrrp_track_process entries. After startup, it uses the process_events
kernel <-> userspace connector to receive notification of process changes. If full_command
is specified for any track_process instance, the cmdline pseudo file will have to be
read upon notification of the creation of the new process, but at that time it is very
unlikely that it will have already been swapped out.
.PP
On a busy system with a high number of process creations/terminations, using a
track_script with pgrep/pidof/killall may be more efficient, although those processes
are inefficient compared to the minimum that keepalived needs.
.PP
Using pgrep etc on a system that is swapping can have a significant detrimental impact
on the performance of the system, due to having to fetch swapped memory from the swap
space, thereby causing additional swapping.
.PP
.SH BFD CONFIGURATION
.PP
This is an implementation of RFC5880 (Bidirectional forwarding detection),
and this can be configured to work between 2 keepalived instances, but using
unweighted track_bfds between a master/backup pair of VRRP instances means that
the VRRP instance will only be able to come up if both VRRP instance are running,
which somewhat defeats the purpose of VRRP.

This implementation has been tested with OpenBFDD (available at

VRRP Sync Group is an extension to VRRP protocol. The main goal is to define a bundle

\fBImportant\fR: for a SYNC group to run reliably, it is vital that all instances in

situation with half instances having higher priority on machine A

.SH LVS CONFIGURATION
contains subblocks of
\fBVirtual server group(s)\fR
and
\fBVirtual server(s)\fR
.PP
The subblocks contain arguments for configuring Linux IPVS (LVS) feature.
Knowledge of
.I ipvsadm(8)
will be helpful here. Configuring LVS is achieved by defining virtual server groups,
virtual servers and optionally SSL configuration. Every virtual server defines a set
of real servers, you can attach healthcheckers to each real server. Keepalived will
then lead LVS operation by dynamically maintaining topology.
.PP
For details of what configuration combinations are valid, see the
.I ipvsadm(8)
man page.
.PP
\fBNote:\fR
Where an option can be configured for a virtual server, real server,
and possibly checker, the virtual server setting is the default for real servers,
and the real server setting is the default for checkers.
.PP
\fBNote:\fR
Tunnelled real/sorry servers can differ from the address family of
the virtual server and non tunnelled real/sorry servers, which all have to be the
same. If a virtual server uses a fwmark, and all the real/sorry servers are
tunnelled, the address family of the virtual server will be the same as the
address family of the real/sorry servers if they are all the same, otherwise
it will default to IPv4 (use ip_family inet6 to override this).
.PP
\fBNote:\fR
The port for the virtual server can only be omitted if the virtual service is persistent.
.PP
.SH Virtual server group(s)
.PP
This feature offers a way to simplify your configuration by factorizing virtual server
definitions. If you need to define a bunch of virtual servers with exactly the same
real server topology then this feature will make your configuration much more readable,
optimize the duplication of IPVS virtual servers if \fInftables_ipvs\fR is used,
and will optimize healthchecking task by only spawning one healthchecker where
multiple virtual servers declaration would spawn a dedicated healthchecker for every
real server which will waste system resources.
.PP
Any combination of IP addresses, IP address ranges and firewall marks can be used, provided
that the family of the IP addresses of the virtual server group match the IP address family
of all the real servers of any virtual server using the virtual server group. The one
exception to this is that the virtual server group can be configured with both IPv4 and IPv6
addresses and fwmarks provided that all the real servers (and sorry servers) of all virtual
servers using the virtual server group use tunnel forwarding; if fwmarks are specified in
this case, the address family must be specified (the one exception to this is if the virtual
server group has no IP addresses (i.e. fwmarks only) and all the real/sorry servers are
tunnelled, it will default to IPv4; it is not good practice to rely on this and the address
families of the fwmarks should be configured).
Use of this option is intended for very large LVSs, but note, this can create a huge number
of virtual servers unless \fInftables_ipvs\fR is used. The use of \fInftables_ipvs\fR is
stringly recommended due to the very significant optimisations and efficiencies it provides.

NOTE: do not configure more than one TCP, one UDP and one SCTP virtual server with the same
IP address family using the same virtual server group (or to put it another way do not have
two virtual servers with the same protocol and address family using the same virtual server
group); if all the real servers are tunnelled, then you must not have both IPv4 and IPv6
virtual servers with the same protocol.

.SH ADVANCED CONFIGURATION
.PP
Configuration parser has been extended to support advanced features such as
conditional configuration and parameter substitution. These features are
very useful for any scripted environment where configuration templates are
generated (datacenters).
.PP
.SH Conditional configuration and configuration id
The config-id defaults to the first part of the node name as returned by
uname, and can be overridden with the -i or --config-id command line option.
.PP
Any configuration line starting with '@' is a conditional configuration line.
The word immediately following (i.e. without any space) the '@' character
is compared against the config-id, and if they don't match, the configuration
line is ignored.
.PP
Alternatively, '@^' is a negative comparison, so if the word immediately
following does NOT match the config-id, the configuration line IS included.
.PP
The purpose of this is to allow a single configuration file to be used for
multiple systems, where the only differences are likely to be the router_id,
vrrp instance priorities, and possibly interface names and unicast addresses.
.PP
For example:
.PP
.nf
    \fBglobal_defs \fR{
        @main   \fBrouter_id \fRmain_router
        @backup \fBrouter_id \fRbackup_router
    }
    ...
    \fBvrrp_instance \fRVRRP {
        ...
        @main    \fBunicast_src_ip \fR1.2.3.4
        @backup  \fBunicast_src_ip \fR1.2.3.5
        @backup2 \fBunicast_src_ip \fR1.2.3.6
        \fBunicast_peer \fR{
            @^main    1.2.3.4
            @^backup  1.2.3.5
            @^backup2 1.2.3.6
        }
        ...
    }
.fi
.PP
If keepalived is invoked with -i main, then the router_id will be set to main_router,
if invoked with -i backup, then backup_router, if not invoked with -i, or with
-i anything else, then the router_id will not be set. The unicast peers for main will
be 1.2.3.5 and 1.2.3.6.
.SH Parameter substitution
Substitutable parameters can be specified. The format for defining a parameter is:
.PP
$PARAMETER=VALUE
.PP
where there must be no space before the '=' and only whitespace may preceed to '$'.
Empty values are allowed.

Parameter names can be made up of any combination of A-Za-z0-9 and _, but cannot start
with a digit. Parameter names starting with an underscore should be considered
reserved names that keepalived will define for various pre-defined options.

After a parameter is defined, any occurrence of $PARAMETER followed by
whitespace, or any occurrence of ${PARAMETER} (which need not be followed by
whitespace) will be replaced by VALUE.

Replacement is recursive, so that if a parameter value itself includes a
replaceable parameter, then after the first substitution, the parameter
in the value will then be replaced; the substitution is done at replacement
time and not at definition time, so for example:
.PP
.nf
    $ADDRESS_BASE=10.2.${ADDRESS_BASE_SUB}
    $ADDRESS_BASE_SUB=0
    ${ADDRESS_BASE}.100/32
    $ADDRESS_BASE_SUB=10
    ${ADDRESS_BASE}.100/32

    will produce:
        10.2.0.100/32
        10.2.10.100/32
.fi
.PP
Note in the above examples the use of both ADDRESS_BASE and ADDRESS_BASE_SUB
required braces ({}) since the parameters were not followed by whitespace
(after the first substitution which produced 10.2.${ADDRESS_BASE_SUB}.100/32
the parameter is still not followed by whitespace).

If a parameter is not defined, it will not be replaced at all, so for
example ${UNDEF_PARAMETER} will remain in the configuration if it is
undefined; this means that existing configuration that contains a '$'
character (for example in a script definition) will not be changed so
long as no new parameter definitions are added to the configuration.

Parameter substitution works in conjunction with conditional configuration.
For example:
.PP
.nf
    @main $PRIORITY=240
    @backup $PRIORITY=200
    \fR...
    \fBvrrp_instance \fRVI_0 {
        \fBpriority \fR$PRIORITY
    }

    will produce:
        \fR...
        \fBvrrp_instance \fRVI_0 {
            \fBpriority \fR240
        }
        if the config_id is main.

    $IF_MAIN=@main
    $IF_MAIN \fBpriority \fR240

    will produce:
        \fBpriority \fR240
        if the config_id is main and nothing if the config_id is not main,
        although why anyone would want to use this rather than simply the
        following is not known (but still possible):
            @main \fBpriority \fR240
.fi
.PP
Multiline definitions are also supported, but when used there must be nothing on the
line after the parameter name. A multiline definition is specified by ending each line
except the last with a '\\' character.
.PP
Example:
.nf
    $INSTANCE= \e
    \fBvrrp_instance \fRVI_${NUM} { \e
        \fBinterface \fReth0.${NUM} \e
        \fBuse_vmac \fRvrrp${NUM}.1 \e

.SH Pre-defined definitions
.PP
The following definitions are pre-defined:
.sp
\fB${_PWD} : \fRThe directory of the current configuration file (this can be changed if using the include directive).
.br
\fB${_INSTANCE} : \fRThe instance name (as defined by the -i option, defaults to hostname).
.br
\fB${_RANDOM [MIN [MAX]]} : \fRThis is replaced by a random integer in the range [MIN, MAX],
where MIN and MAX are optional non-negative integers. Defaults are MIN=0 and MAX=32767.
.br
\fB${_HASH} : \fR This is replaced by a '#' character, which would otherwise start a comment
.br
\fB${_BANG} : \fR This is replaced by a '!' character, which would otherwise start a comment
.PP
Additional pre-defined definitions will be added as their need is identified.
It will normally be quite straightforward to add additional pre-defined
definitions, so if you need one, or have a good idea for one, then raise
an issue at https://github.com/acassen/keepalived/issues requesting it.
.SH Sequence blocks
.PP
A line starting \fB~SEQ(var, start, step, end)\fR will cause the remainder of the
line to be processed multiple times, with the variable \fB$var\fR set initially to
\fBstart\fR, and then \fB$var\fR will be incremented by \fBstep\fR repeatedly, terminating when
it is greater than \fBend\fR. \fBstep\fR may be omitted, in which case it defaults to 1 or
-1, depending on whether \fBend\fR is greater or less than \fBstart\fR. \fBstart\fR may also be
omitted, in which case it defaults to 1 if \fBend\fR > 0 or -1 if \fBend\fR < 0.
~SEQx(...) is the same as ~SEQ(...), except the variable $var will for formatted in hexadecimal,
which would be useful for IPv6 addresses.

Note: At the moment it is necessary to use different variables for the ~SEQ block from any
previously defined variable, including one used as the variable in a previous ~SEQ block.
This may change in the future, so do not rely on a ~SEQ block variable being defined after
the end of the block.

Examples:
.PP
.nf
    ~SEQ(SUBNET, 0, 3) ip_address 10.0.${SUBNET}.1

    would produce:
        ip_address 10.0.0.1
        ip_address 10.0.1.1
        ip_address 10.0.2.1
        ip_address 10.0.3.1

and
    ~SEQx(SUBNET, 144, 16, 192) ip_address fe80::20:${SUBNET}:1
  or better
    ~SEQx(SUBNET, 0x90, 0x10, 0xc0) ip_address fe80::20:${SUBNET}:1

    would produce:
        ip_address fe80::20:90:1
        ip_address fe80::20:a0:1
        ip_address fe80::20:b0:1
        ip_address fe80::20:c0:1

   Another example:

	virtual_ipaddress {
	    ~SEQx(AD2, 0x90, 0x10, 0xc0) ~SEQx(AD1, 0x12, -1, 0x0c) fe81::10:${AD2}:${AD1}
	}
.fi
.PP
There can be multiple ~SEQ elements on a line, so for example:
.PP
.nf
    $VI4= \e
    \fBtrack_file \fRoffset_instance_4.${IF}.${NUM}.${ID} { \e
        \fBfile \fR"${_PWD}/679/track_files/4.${IF}.${NUM}.${ID}" \e
        \fBweight \fR-100 \e
    } \e
    \fBvrrp_instance \fRvrrp4.${IF}.${NUM}.${ID} { \e
        \fBinterface \fRbond${IF}.${NUM} \e
        \fBuse_vmac \fRvrrp4.${IF}.${NUM}.${ID} \e
        \fBvirtual_router_id \fR${ID} \e
        \fBpriority \fR130 \e
        \fBvirtual_ipaddress \fR{ \e
            10.${IF}.${NUM}.${ID}/24 \e
        } \e
        \fBtrack_file \fR{ \e
            offset_instance_4.${IF}.${NUM}.${ID} \e
        } \e
    }

    \fB~SEQ\fR(IF,0,7) \fB~SEQ\fR(NUM,0,31) \fB~SEQ\fR(ID,1,254) $VI4

    will produce 65024 vrrp instances with names from vrrp4.0.0.1 through to
    vrrp4.7.31.254.
.fi
.SH List blocks
.PP
List blocks are similar to sequence blocks, except that the values to substitute into
the variable are listed in the ~LST specification.

A line starting \fB~LST(var, val1, val2, val3)\fR will cause the remainder of the
line to be processed multiple times, with the variable \fB$var\fR set initially to
\fBval1\fR, and then \fBval2\fR, and finally \fBval3\fR. Any number of values can be
specified, as long as at least one value is (although only one value would be pointless).

If it is desired to substitute more than one variable at a time, the variables and values
need to be enclosed in {...} blocks. For example:

    ~LST({IP, IP1}, {10,1},{20,4},{5,6},{12,8}) 192.168.${IP}.${IP1}

would first set IP=10 and IP1=1, then IP=20 and IP1=4, etc, and produces:

    192.168.10.1
    192.168.20.4
    192.168.5.6
    192.168.12.8

List blocks can be nested, so:

    ~LST(IP, 1, 2, 3, 4) ~LST(IP1, 5,6,7) 192.169.${IP}.${IP1}

produces:
    192.169.1.5
    192.169.1.6
    192.169.1.7
    192.169.2.5
    192.169.2.6
    192.169.2.7
    192.169.3.5
    192.169.3.6
    192.169.3.7
    192.169.4.5
    192.169.4.6
    192.169.4.7

Finally, list blocks and sequence blocks can be combined, so:

    ~LST({IP, IP1}, {10,1},{20,4},{5,6},{12,8}) ~SEQ(IP2,168,2,172) 192.${IP2}.${IP}.${IP1}

produces:

    192.168.10.1
    192.170.10.1
    192.172.10.1
    192.168.20.4
    192.170.20.4
    192.172.20.4
    192.168.5.6
    192.170.5.6
    192.172.5.6
    192.168.12.8
    192.170.12.8
    192.172.12.8

.SH KERNEL SETTINGS
It has been identified that if \fBproxy_arp\fR and \fBproxy_arp_pvlan\fR are enabled
on an interface that has VIPs or eVIPs configured on it, it can cause incorrect replies
to ARP requests due to the proxy replying to the ARP request as well as the keepalived
host. Both need to be set to 0 to function properly.
