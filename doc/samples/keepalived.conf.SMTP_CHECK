! Configuration File for keepalived
!
! The SMTP_CHECK connects to a smtp server
! and checks with the following dialogue:
!
! 220 mta1.somecompany.com ESMTP
! HELO foo.bar.com
! 250 mta1.somecompany.com Hello foo.bar.com [192.168.1.45], pleased to meet you
! QUIT
! 221 2.0.0 mta1.somecompany.com closing connection
!
! It specifically checks the numeric codes returned (220, 250, and 221).

! In this real_server example we will simply check
! the ip address of the real_server. This could be
! the case where the real server only has a single
! interface that keepalived is balancing traffic
! to.

    real_server 172.16.1.10 25 {
        weight 1
        SMTP_CHECK {
            connect_timeout 30
            retry 2
            delay_before_retry 5
            helo_name "foo.bar.com"
        }
    }

! In this complex example, the real_server has
! multiple interfaces. Keepalived is sending traffic
! to 172.16.1.11 but the smtp server also routes
! traffic to some additional subnets. We do not
! want to dispatch traffic unless all the interfaces
! appear to be up. Note: The main ip of the real
! server that we are dispatching traffic to must
! explicitly be checked by a host directive.

    real_server 172.16.1.11 25 {
        weight 1
        SMTP_CHECK {
            connect_timeout 10
            retry 2
            delay_before_retry 5
            helo_name foo.bar.com

            host {
                connect_ip 172.16.1.11
            }

            host {
                connect_ip  192.168.155.10
            }

            host {
                connect_ip  64.233.167.99
            }
        }
    }


! Final example showing some of the more extended
! features.
!
! Use connect_port to provide an alternate port
! other than the default 25.
!
! Use bindto to force the connection to originate
! from a specific interface.

    real_server 172.16.1.12 25 {
        weight 1
        SMTP_CHECK {
            connect_timeout 10
            retry 2
            delay_before_retry 5
            helo_name "foo.bar.com"

            host {
                connect_ip 172.16.1.12
                connect_port 25
                bindto 172.16.1.2
            }

            host {
                connect_ip  192.168.155.11
                connect_port 25
                bindto 192.168.155.2
