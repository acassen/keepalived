For building the documentation, the following packages need to be installed:
	py-sphinx py3-sphinx_rtd_theme
   For latex or pdf files, you'll need texlive or similar, which is not yet
   available as a distro package.


Archlinux
---------
Run the following to install the required libraries:
	pacman -S ipset libnfnetlink libnl1
For magic file identification support:
	TBD

Installing from a git repo
==========================
To install from a git repo, execute:
  1. Ensure you have autoconf and automake installed
  2. git clone http://github.com/acassen/keepalived
  3. cd keepalived
  4. ./build_setup	# generate the autoconf and automake environment
  5. Follow the instructions below for Installation, omitting the first two steps.

Installation
============

  1. tar -xf TARFILE
  2. cd into the directory
  3. './configure'
  4. 'make'
  5. 'make install'. This will install keepalived on your system,
     binaries and configuration file :
     * keepalived : The keepalived daemon program.
     * genhash : The MD5 url digest generator. You need it to
                 configure HTTP GET check and SSL GET check in
                 order to compute MD5SUM digest etalon.
     * /etc/keepalived/keepalived.conf
  6. link keepalived.init into your runlevel directory. On Red Hat systems :
     ln -s /etc/rc.d/init.d/keepalived.init /etc/rc.d/rc3.d/S99keepalived

  By default the configure script uses /usr/local as base directory. You can
  change this value to your own by passing it the --prefix value.

  eg: './configure --prefix=/usr/'

Building RPM files
==================

 If building from tarball:
  1a. tar -xf TARFILE
  1b. cd into the directory

 If building from git clone:
  1. ./build_setup 

 For tarball and git
  2. ./configure
  3. make rpm

 The .rpm files will be created in directory `rpm --eval "%{_rpmdir}"`/ARCH

Modifying source code
=====================

If you modify the source code, especially configure.ac or any Makefile.am
file, you will need to regenerate the build files. Keepalived uses automake
and so you will need to have automake and autoconf installed.

Configuration
=============

  Just take a look at the /etc/keepalived/keepalived.conf file installed.
  It will give you all the information needed. Alternativley, run
  'man keepalived.conf' or look at doc/keepalived.conf.SYNOPSIS.
  If you want more information about keepalived, please refer to the
  keepalived homepage into the documentation section.

Creating a docker container
===========================
There is a very useful github project maintained by osixia for building a
docker container with keepalived.

To use, run the following:
git clone https://github.com/osixia/docker-keepalived.git
cd docker-keepalived
make build
docker run --name keepalived --cap-add=NET_ADMIN --net=host \
  --env KEEPALIVED_INTERFACE=eth0 -d osixia/keepalived:1.3.5 \
	# or whatever version of keepalived you have

To update the keepalived source code, put a new tarball in the image
directory (the Dockerfile may need updating with a new version).

Useful docker commands are:
docker logs keepalvied 2>&1 | lessa	# view system logs of container
docker exec it keepalived bash		# execute shell in container
docker rm -f keepalived			# Remove the container

keepalived is unable to load the ip_tables, ip6_tables, xt_set and ip_vs
modules from within the container, so ensure they are already loaded in
the host system.

To generate a core file in the root filesystem of the container,
/proc/sys/kernel/core_pattern needs to be updated in the host system,
and not from the container (or in other words the -M option to keepalived
does not work within a container. Installing gdb in the container (edit
the image/Dockerfile to add it before make build) may be helpful if you
need to examine core files in the container.



Have fun with it !
