The main goal of the keepalived project is to add a strong & robust
keepalive facility to the Linux Virtual Server project.
It implements a multilayer TCP/IP stack checks. Keepalived implements
a framework based on three family checks : Layer3, Layer4 & Layer5. 
This framework gives the daemon the ability of checking a LVS server 
pool states. Keepalived can be sumarize as a LVS driving daemon.

To generate MD5SUM digest the this tool (genhash) is used.

Keepalived is free software. See the file COPYING for copying conditions.
