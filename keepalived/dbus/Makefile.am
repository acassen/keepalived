# XML_MATCH is used for converting an .xml_template file into an
# .xml file. Any lines in the .xml_template file that don't start with
# a string of capital letters followed by a tab or new line will be passed
# through to the .xml file. If XML_FILE comprises a capital letter, then lines
# that have that capital letter in an initial string of capitals will also be
# passed to the .xml file, but with the initial capitals and tab removed.
# e.g. if XML_MATCH = C, then
# ABCD	fred		# will be passed through as 'fred' and
# ABXY	joe		# will not be passed
#
# Below are further more complex examples:
# XML_MATCH = C[A-Z]*X	# pass lines that have a C followed by an X (possibly with other letters in between)
# XML_MATCH = [CX]	# pass lines their have C or X (or both)
# XML_MATCH = [CX][A-Z]*[CX] # pass lines with C and X in either order (or two C's or two X's)
# 			     # C[A-Z]*X is preferred if all option letters are in alphabetical order
