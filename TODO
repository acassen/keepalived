Whatever you want !

ipvs_group_range_cmd() appears nonsense, and inet_stor returning a uint8_t
doesn't work for IPv6. The virtual_service_entry_t thing needs range to be
uint32_t. Why would mask be 0xffffffff for IPv6?

init_if_linkbeat should only be done for interfaces that are used or tracked

ip_vs_daemon_kern vs /usr/include/linux/ip_vs.h ip_vs_daemon_user

vrrp_timer_fd should return 0 if an fd's timer is in the past?

ensure all ifindex are ifindex_t (change typedef to float to get compiler warnings)

Stop using ifp->base_if_index

Stop using if_vmac_reflect_flags

Get rid of vmac_ifi_flags

Make vrrp_update_priority() void

Make vrrp->send_buffer a single buffer for all

Check timers passto to thread_... functions are reasonable, and stacktrace if not.

In function socket_state, should thread_add_write use timer_long() or -timer_long()

vrrp_timer_fd() - see comment

In thread functions with a timer, ensure not > LONG_MAX (or even some lower value);

Change tcp_socket_state etc to socket_state etc

Add noreturn function attribute on stop_vrrp/check

bin/genhash -s 2001:470:69dd:35::188 --port 80 -u /Harriet/     # works, but
bin/genhash -s 2001:470:69dd:35::188 --port 80 -u /Harriet/     # -S doesn;t
                                                                # but -S is OK with IPv5 address

in ipvswrapper.c, get rid of static srule etc and make them procedure local and pass as parameters
